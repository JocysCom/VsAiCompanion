# Jocys.com VS AI Companion
This is a free, open-source project for people who have an [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/) (GPT-3/4, Davinci...) subscription or/and run Open AI on their local machine ([GPT4All](https://gpt4all.io/)), on-premises, or on Azure Cloud.

The AI Companion is a tool that answers questions, analyzes project files, and works alongside, streamlining development and boosting productivity. Application allows easy creation of custom, fine-tuned AI models as chatbots or virtual employees. subscription. It's like a Swiss Army Knife of AI for developers. AI Companion can run as a standalone portable application or as a Visual Studio extension. Extension version can also be installed via Visual Studio Extension Manager.

### Why Use Tools Utilizing API Instead of Web Chat GPT?

- Data submitted via the API is not used to train or improve its models, unless customers explicitly decide to share their data.
- Web Chat is limited to 4K tokens, while AI models on API can process data 4-8 times larger.
- API provides access to more recent and smarter AI models.

### System Requirements
- Microsoft .NET 8.0
  https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet
- For VS Extension: Visual Studio 2022 17.9+ (update through Visual Studio Installer)

### Why was this extension created?
Existing tools like GitHub CoPilot have limitations when it comes to interacting with AI. I wanted to create an app that could handle common tasks with more in-depth AI guidance and information. This tool does not replace GitHub CoPilot, but rather offers new features. My goal was to create a tool that would assist AI in responding to inquiries about an entire project or in revamping a Visual Studio solution using a different framework. Right now, you have the ability to request a project rewrite, as the extension can send an entire project or solution. However, there are some necessary updates that need to be made in order to save the outcomes.

### Limitations
You can ask questions about an entire solution or project using the "Code - Smart Search" template. However, the size of the solution or project is limited by the maximum amount of tokens the AI can process. People who have access to the GPT-4 API can upload projects or solutions for AI analysis, up to sizes of 384KB (128K tokens, about 3 bytes per token). These limitations could potentially be removed if AI is hosted on-premises.

### Rate Limits
Rate limits are restrictions that OpenAI API imposes on the number of times a user or client can access its services within a specified period of time: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits/usage-tiers

### How it works
This application (or extension) allows you to create advanced prompt templates and include data from various sources such as the Clipboard, Selection, Active Document, Selected Documents, Active Project, Selected Project, Solution, Selected Error, Exception with relevant code files, or Chat History. You can execute this template with just one button press, and the data will be sent to your preferred AI model for results at https://api.openai.com.

### Data Safety Concerns
OpenAI will not use the data submitted by customers via the OpenAI API to train or improve its models, unless customers explicitly decide to share their data for this purpose. Customers have the option to opt-in to share data. Please note that this data policy does not apply to OpenAI's Non-API consumer services like ChatGPT or DALLÂ·E.
