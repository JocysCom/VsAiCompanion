Disable Building:

The project will be added to the solution as `FAE04EC0-301F-11D3-BF4B-00C04F79EFBC` C# type.

	```
	Project("{FAE04EC0-301F-11D3-BF4B-00C04F79EFBC}") = "_Solution Items", "_Solution Items.csproj", "{PROJECT_GUID}"
	EndProject
	```

To prevent it from building, remove all .Build.0 lines. For example:

	```
	{PROJECT_GUID}.Release|Any CPU.Build.0 = Release|Any CPU
	{PROJECT_GUID}.Debug|Any CPU.Build.0 = Debug|Any CPU
	```

Rename `Debug` and `Release` configuration names to any other name, for example `DisableBuild`:

	```
	GlobalSection(ProjectConfigurationPlatforms) = postSolution
		...
		{PROJECT_GUID}.Debug|Any CPU.ActiveCfg = DisableBuild|Any CPU
		{PROJECT_GUID}.Release|Any CPU.ActiveCfg = DisableBuild|Any CPU
	EndGlobalSection
	```

This will result in the builder skipping building the project:

	```
	Rebuild started at 12:20...
	====== Skipped Rebuild All: Project: _Solution Items ======
	========== Rebuild All: 0 succeeded, 0 failed, 1 skipped ==========
	========== Rebuild completed at 12:20 and took 00.072 seconds ==========
	```
