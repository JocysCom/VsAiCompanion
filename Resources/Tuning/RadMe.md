## GPT-2

Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT-2) is an open-source language model developed by OpenAI. GPT-2 has the ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given input prompt. It utilizes a transformer-based architecture and was one of the first instances of a language model that could create believable text, demonstrating the potential of deep learning in understanding and generating human-like text.
