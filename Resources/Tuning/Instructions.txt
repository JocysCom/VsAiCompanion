I have uploaded the AI model training script files. Other files:

`Step0-1-Config.json` content:
```JSON
{
	"MODEL_NAME": "microsoft/Orca-2-7b",
	"CERT_FILE_PATH": "./Data/trusted_root_certificates.pem",
	"CACHE_DIR": "./Data/model_cache",
	"DATA_PATH": "./Data/data.jsonl",
	"DATA_TRAIN_PATH": "./Data/data.train.jsonl",
	"DATA_VALIDATION_PATH": "./Data/data.validation.jsonl",
	"DATA_TEST_PATH": "./Data/data.test.jsonl",
	"TOKENIZED_DATA_DIR": "./Data/tokenized_data",
	"TOKENIZED_DATA_COMBINED_DIR": "./Data/tokenized_data_combined",
	"TOKENIZED_DATA_OUTPUT_DIR": "./Data/tokenized_data_output",
	"NEW_OUTPUT_DIR": "./Fine-Tuned/Model",
	"OUTPUT_MAX_LENGTH": 2048,
	"USE_GPU_CUDA": true,
	"USE_GPU_TENSOR": true
}
```

`data.jsonl` format is described inside `Step2-2-SplitData-data.yaml` file and this is content example:

```jsonl
{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant of Doughnut Dynamics."},{"role":"user","content":"What is the name of your company?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"The name of our company is Doughnut Dynamics."}]}
{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant of Doughnut Dynamics."},{"role":"user","content":"What is your company's slogan?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Our company's slogan is 'Donut worry, be happy!'"}]}
```

There is a problem with executing the `python Step3-1-TrainModel.py` script. The script terminates after running for some time.

The purpose of the script is to fine-tune and train this AI model: https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Orca-2-7b

Please analyze the attached script files. The script files are intended to be run in their naming order. Try to identify anything that could cause the issue, using a step-by-step thinking process.
