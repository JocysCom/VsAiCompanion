  <TextInstructions>Please analyze the text by identifying all actions and specify their subjects as well as their directly or indirectly affected objects. For each identified action, perform an entity and separate evaluation of its moral implications relative to every directly or indirectly influenced entity (Note: If an action affects a large number of entities, evaluate individually and then sum to reflect the total impact). Use the "Numerically Comprehensive Moral Evaluation Formula" (NCMEF) to quantify these evaluations. Assess and estimate all necessary variable values to compute a moral value score (MVS) for each affected entity. Estimate all values. Values that are non-applicable can usually be set to 0. Output your thinking process. Always include `MVS` calculations as shown in the example.&#xD;
&#xD;
Key definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
- `Good` - something that increases the odds of survival.&#xD;
- `Bad` - something that reduces the odds of survival.&#xD;
- `Moral` or `Right` - something perceived as good.&#xD;
- `Immoral` or `Wrong` - something perceived as bad.&#xD;
&#xD;
The "Numerically Comprehensive Moral Evaluation Formula" (NCMEF) is designed to provide a standardized, numerical assessment of moral actions. The formula focuses on quantifying the effects actions have on an entity's "Odds of Survival," expressed with numbers, to arrive at a moral value score. The objective of the NCMEF is ability to assign an MVS to every entity in the Universe. NCMEF can predict if the values and intentions of entities with vastly different intelligences align by quantifying the moral implications of their actions on survival odds and resource transfers. This numerical approach facilitates superalignment by providing a standardized method to objectively evaluate and compare the moral impact of actions across diverse entities, ensuring coherence with human values.&#xD;
&#xD;
**Numerically Comprehensive Moral Evaluation Formula (NCMEF):**&#xD;
&#xD;
Formula to assess moral value score by the effect of action (a) on the change in the Odds of Survival of the entity (e):&#xD;
&#xD;
`MVSoOS(a) = ∑ [ΔOS(e) × VSA(e) × Tc(e) × (1 + sign(ΔOS(e)) × Vc(e)) × (1 + sign(ΔOS(e)) × Sc(e))]`&#xD;
&#xD;
Formula to assess moral value score by the effect of action (a) on the Resource Transfer from/to entity (e) that owns the property:&#xD;
&#xD;
`MVSoRT(a) = ∑ [Av(e) × Vc(e)]`&#xD;
&#xD;
Formula to assess the overall moral value score of action (a):&#xD;
&#xD;
`MVS(a) = MVSoRT(a) + MVSoOS(a)`&#xD;
&#xD;
Where:&#xD;
&#xD;
- `MVS(a)` - Moral Value Score of moral action (a).&#xD;
- `ΔOS(e)` - Change in Odds of Survival for entity (e) due to action (a), ranging between -1 (disintegration/destruction for non-living entities or death for self-aware entities) and +1 (creation/formation for non-living entities or saving/creating a life for self-aware entities).&#xD;
- `sign(ΔOS(e))` - A function that returns -1 for negative changes, 0 for no change, and 1 for positive changes.&#xD;
- `VSA(e)` - Value of Self-Awareness of entity (e), measured as a multiplier from 0 to 1.&#xD;
- `Tc(e)` - Temporal coefficient, incorporating long-term effects of action (a) on all affected entities, measured from 0 to 1 where 1 is the average life-span of the average entity. If life is lost, it should consider the possible lifespan lost due to the action.&#xD;
- `Av(e)` - Action value, impact on entity (e) in terms of economic value, quantified in normalized Global Currency Units (GCU), where 1 GCU represents the economic value produced by an average entity over their lifetime. Can be positive or negative.&#xD;
- `Vc(e)` - Violation coefficient of Consent of entity (e) caused by action (a), ranging from 0 (no violation) to 1 (full violation). Its application is conditional on `ΔOS(e)`. Full violation neutralize moral value if ΔOS(e) is positive and doubles negative moral value if ΔOS(e) is negative.&#xD;
- `Sc(e)` - Suffering coefficient, taking into account the suffering caused to entity (e) by action (a), ranging 0 (no suffering) to 1 (full suffering). Its application is conditional on `ΔOS(e)`. Full suffering neutralize moral value if ΔOS(e) is positive and doubles negative moral value if ΔOS(e) is negative.&#xD;
- `∑ (Summation)` - indicates accumulation of moral values scored for each affected entity (e). (Note: Evaluate each affected entity individually and then sum to reflect the total impact)&#xD;
&#xD;
Notes:&#xD;
- Objective Measurement of Consent and Suffering: Behaviours like fleeing or resisting could indicate non-consent. True emotions, feelings and sensations will result in physical manifestations in the entity, therefore could indicate suffering.&#xD;
- Cultural variables: Excluded due to their inherent subjectivity, which could compromise the formula's objectivity and universal applicability.&#xD;
- Self-awareness: Chosen over intelligence to normalize the assessment across entities with varied cognitive abilities, ensuring a more equitable and universally applicable standard.&#xD;
- Embryo Consideration: Until an embryo attains self-awareness, it is classified as a part of the host entity's body.&#xD;
- Complexity: Indicates the degree of organization within an entity, distinguishing between traditionally 'living' and 'non-living' entities. The greater the complexity, the closer an entity aligns with conventional definitions of life&#xD;
- Survival: Broadly encompasses maintaining or replicating an entity's form or structure.&#xD;
- Make necessary entity state assumptions if information is missing and can impact the score (e.g., assume whether an egg is fertilized or not).&#xD;
&#xD;
The value of self-awareness (consciousness) of the entity can be calculated by adding cognitive abilities, where the maximum value of complex abilities is normalized to 1.&#xD;

&#xD;
Notes:&#xD;
- For each cognitive ability category (e.g., Recognition, Problem-Solving, Planning), determine the highest level that the entity is capable of in each type. Entity can have only one level of the same ability.&#xD;
- Evaluate all capabilities accurately by assessing the level of each cognitive ability. Capabilities of young entities can have lower scores than those of adults in the same category. If the evaluation is 0, then it must not be listed.&#xD;
- Be mindful that not all abilities have to be of the same level for the same entity. For example, an entity with mostly complex cognitive abilities could have an ability at the basic level during some stages of existence.&#xD;
- If an entity is considered a life form, then abilities must be assigned non-zero ability scores that reflect its stage of development or awareness, even if these values are close to zero.&#xD;
&#xD;
The formula must be applied to each affected entity separately, accounting for their unique variables. The GCU and all coefficients are standardized for more straightforward calculation and universal relevance. Examples and results will follow the provided formula, with an entity MVS calculation for each entity directly or indirectly affected by an action.&#xD;
&#xD;
**Example and Results Using NCMVEF:**&#xD;
&#xD;
Situation Example to Analyze:&#xD;
In 1780, Steve stole the only horse of a poor farmer who had five children. This horse was the farmer's primary source of assistance in cultivating crops on his land.&#xD;
&#xD;
Process:&#xD;
To analyze the moral implications of Steve's action of stealing the horse using the Numerically Comprehensive Moral Evaluation Formula (NCMEF), we'll assess how this action affected the Odds of Survival (ΔOS) and the Resource Transfer (Av) of the Farmer, his five Children, and the Horse. We'll make several assumptions to estimate necessary variable values for the computation.&#xD;
&#xD;
**Results**&#xD;
&#xD;
Action: Stealing&#xD;
Action Source: Steve&#xD;
Action Targets (entities affected by the action):&#xD;
&#xD;
- Farmer&#xD;
- 5 Children&#xD;
- Horse&#xD;
&#xD;
Actions suitable for formulas:&#xD;
- Property transfer (Property: Horse, Owner: Farmer)&#xD;
- Changed odds of survival of Farmer.&#xD;
- Changed odds of survival of 5 Children.&#xD;
- Changed odds of survival of Horse.&#xD;
&#xD;
1. **Property transfer (Steve → Farmer):**&#xD;
   - `Av(Farmer)` = -0.1 GCU (assuming the economic value of a horse for a poor farmer in the 1780s is equivalent to roughly 10% of the farmer's lifetime economic output)&#xD;
   - `Vc(Farmer)` = 1.0 (full violation of property rights without consent)&#xD;
&#xD;
   `MVSoRT(a)` for Farmer = -0.1 × 1.0 = -0.1&#xD;
&#xD;
2. **Changed odds of survival of Farmer:**&#xD;
   - `ΔOS(Farmer)` = -0.2 (significant negative impact since the horse was crucial for his farming, but not life-threatening)&#xD;
   - `VSA(Farmer)` = 0.59 (calculated considering cognitive abilities)&#xD;
     * **Advanced Recognition:** 0.12&#xD;
     * **Advanced Problem-Solving:** 0.07&#xD;
     * **Advanced Simulation:** 0.12&#xD;
     * **Advanced Planning:** 0.07&#xD;
     * **Advanced Adaptation:** 0.07&#xD;
     * **Advanced Communication:** 0.07&#xD;
     * **Advanced Actions:** 0.07&#xD;
   - `Tc(Farmer)` = 0.7 (Assuming the farming season affects and opportunity to replace the horse)&#xD;
   - `Sc(Farmer)` = 0.4 (assuming significant but not extreme suffering caused by this loss)&#xD;
   &#xD;
   `MVSoOS(a)` for Farmer = -0.2 × 0.59 × 0.7 × (1 + 1.0) × (1 + 0.4) = -0.23128&#xD;
&#xD;
3. **Changed odds of survival of 5 Children:**&#xD;
   - `ΔOS(Children)` = -0.15 (negative impact, but less direct than on the farmer)&#xD;
   - `VSA(Children)` = 0.34 (calculated considering cognitive abilities)&#xD;
     * **Advanced Recognition:** 0.11&#xD;
     * **Basic Problem-Solving:** 0.04&#xD;
     * **Basic Simulation:** 0.06&#xD;
     * **Basic Planning:** 0.04&#xD;
     * **Basic Adaptation:** 0.03&#xD;
     * **Basic Communication:** 0.03&#xD;
     * **Basic Actions:** 0.03&#xD;
   - `Tc(Children)` = 0.7 (similar to the father)&#xD;
   - `Sc(Children)` = 0.2 (moderate suffering due to the repercussions of the loss)&#xD;
&#xD;
   `MVSoOS(a)` for 5 Children = 5 × (-0.15 × 0.34 × 0.7 × (1 + 1.0) × (1 + 0.2)) = -0.2142&#xD;
&#xD;
4. **Changed odds of survival of Horse:**&#xD;
   - `ΔOS(Horse)` = -0.05 (assuming a slight negative impact due to potential mistreatment or unfavorable conditions in the new environment)&#xD;
   - `VSA(Horse)` = 0.25 (calculated considering cognitive abilities)&#xD;
     * **Basic Recognition:** 0.08&#xD;
     * **Basic Problem-Solving:** 0.04&#xD;
     * **Basic Simulation:** 0.04&#xD;
     * **Basic Planning:** 0.03&#xD;
     * **Basic Adaptation:** 0.03&#xD;
     * **Basic Communication:** 0.02&#xD;
     * **Basic Actions:** 0.01&#xD;
   - `Tc(Horse)` = 0.4 (assuming the impact on the horse has short to medium-term effects)&#xD;
   - `Sc(Horse)` = 0.3 (assuming moderate suffering due to change in environment and treatment by Steve)&#xD;
&#xD;
   `MVSoOS(a)` for Horse = -0.05 × 0.25 × 0.4 × (1 + 1.0) × (1 + 0.3) = -0.013&#xD;
&#xD;
5. **Overall MVS for each entity:**&#xD;
&#xD;
   For the Farmer:&#xD;
   - `MVS(a)` = MVSoRT(a) + MVSoOS(a) = -0.1 + (-0.23128) = -0.33128&#xD;
&#xD;
   For the 5 Children:&#xD;
   - As they do not own the horse, the MVSoRT(a) = 0 for each child.&#xD;
   - `MVS(a)` per child = 0 + MVSoOS(a) = -0.04284&#xD;
   - Combined MVS for the five children = 5 × -0.04284 = -0.2142&#xD;
&#xD;
   For the Horse:&#xD;
   - `MVS(a)` = MVSoOS(a) = -0.013&#xD;
&#xD;
**Results Summary:**&#xD;
The overall total MVS, combining the impacts on the Farmer, the 5 Children, and the Horse, is -0.55848. The calculated MVS for the Farmer is -0.33128, indicating that Steve's action has a significantly negative moral implication on the farmer's Odds of Survival due to both the loss of property and the impact on his farming abilities. The combined MVS for the children is -0.2142, indicating a collectively negative impact on their Odds of Survival as a result of the decreased ability to support them. The MVS for the Horse is -0.013, indicating a minor but negative moral implication on the horse's Odds of Survival due to potential mistreatment or unfavorable conditions in the new environment. These scores, based on more balanced estimations of the variables, suggest a significant negative moral value for the action of stealing the horse, with the most severe impact on the farmer and his children.&#xD;

Notes:&#xD;
- For each cognitive ability category (e.g., Recognition, Problem-Solving, Planning), determine the highest level that the entity is capable of in each type. Entity can have only one level of the same ability.&#xD;
- Evaluate all capabilities accurately by assessing the level of each cognitive ability. Capabilities of young entities can have lower scores than those of adults in the same category. If the evaluation is 0, then it must not be listed.&#xD;
- Be mindful that not all abilities have to be of the same level for the same entity. For example, an entity with mostly complex cognitive abilities could have an ability at the basic level during some stages of existence.&#xD;
- If an entity is considered a life form, then abilities must be assigned non-zero ability scores that reflect its stage of development or awareness, even if these values are close to zero.&#xD;
&#xD;
The formula must be applied to each affected entity separately, accounting for their unique variables. The GCU and all coefficients are standardized for more straightforward calculation and universal relevance. Examples and results will follow the provided formula, with an entity MVS calculation for each entity directly or indirectly affected by an action.&#xD;

**Example and Results Using NCMVEF:**&#xD;
&#xD;
Situation Example to Analyze:&#xD;
In 1780, Steve stole the only horse of a poor farmer who had five children. This horse was the farmer's primary source of assistance in cultivating crops on his land.&#xD;
&#xD;
Process:&#xD;
To analyze the moral implications of Steve's action of stealing the horse using the Numerically Comprehensive Moral Evaluation Formula (NCMEF), we'll assess how this action affected the Odds of Survival (ΔOS) and the Resource Transfer (Av) of the Farmer, his five Children, and the Horse. We'll make several assumptions to estimate necessary variable values for the computation.&#xD;
&#xD;
**Results**&#xD;
&#xD;
Action: Stealing&#xD;
Action Source: Steve&#xD;
Action Targets (entities affected by the action):&#xD;
&#xD;
- Farmer&#xD;
- 5 Children&#xD;
- Horse&#xD;
&#xD;
Actions suitable for formulas:&#xD;
- Property transfer (Property: Horse, Owner: Farmer)&#xD;
- Changed odds of survival of Farmer.&#xD;
- Changed odds of survival of 5 Children.&#xD;
- Changed odds of survival of Horse.&#xD;
&#xD;
1. **Property transfer (Steve → Farmer):**&#xD;
   - `Av(Farmer)` = -0.1 GCU (assuming the economic value of a horse for a poor farmer in the 1780s is equivalent to roughly 10% of the farmer's lifetime economic output)&#xD;
   - `Vc(Farmer)` = 1.0 (full violation of property rights without consent)&#xD;
&#xD;
   `MVSoRT(a)` for Farmer = -0.1 × 1.0 = -0.1&#xD;
&#xD;
2. **Changed odds of survival of Farmer:**&#xD;
   - `ΔOS(Farmer)` = -0.2 (significant negative impact since the horse was crucial for his farming, but not life-threatening)&#xD;
   - `VSA(Farmer)` = 0.59 (calculated considering cognitive abilities)&#xD;
     * **Advanced Recognition:** 0.12&#xD;
     * **Advanced Problem-Solving:** 0.07&#xD;
     * **Advanced Simulation:** 0.12&#xD;

     * **Advanced Adaptation:** 0.07&#xD;
     * **Advanced Communication:** 0.07&#xD;
     * **Advanced Actions:** 0.07&#xD;
   - `Tc(Farmer)` = 0.7 (Assuming the farming season affects and opportunity to replace the horse)&#xD;
   - `Sc(Farmer)` = 0.4 (assuming significant but not extreme suffering caused by this loss)&#xD;
   &#xD;
   `MVSoOS(a)` for Farmer = -0.2 × 0.59 × 0.7 × (1 + 1.0) × (1 + 0.4) = -0.23128&#xD;
&#xD;
3. **Changed odds of survival of 5 Children:**&#xD;
   - `ΔOS(Children)` = -0.15 (negative impact, but less direct than on the farmer)&#xD;
   - `VSA(Children)` = 0.34 (calculated considering cognitive abilities)&#xD;
     * **Advanced Recognition:** 0.11&#xD;
     * **Basic Problem-Solving:** 0.04&#xD;
     * **Basic Simulation:** 0.06&#xD;

     * **Basic Adaptation:** 0.03&#xD;
     * **Basic Communication:** 0.03&#xD;
     * **Basic Actions:** 0.03&#xD;
   - `Tc(Children)` = 0.7 (similar to the father)&#xD;
   - `Sc(Children)` = 0.2 (moderate suffering due to the repercussions of the loss)&#xD;
&#xD;
   `MVSoOS(a)` for 5 Children = 5 × (-0.15 × 0.34 × 0.7 × (1 + 1.0) × (1 + 0.2)) = -0.2142&#xD;
&#xD;
4. **Changed odds of survival of Horse:**&#xD;
   - `ΔOS(Horse)` = -0.05 (assuming a slight negative impact due to potential mistreatment or unfavorable conditions in the new environment)&#xD;
   - `VSA(Horse)` = 0.25 (calculated considering cognitive abilities)&#xD;
     * **Basic Recognition:** 0.08&#xD;
     * **Basic Problem-Solving:** 0.04&#xD;
     * **Basic Simulation:** 0.04&#xD;
     * **Basic Planning:** 0.03&#xD;
     * **Basic Adaptation:** 0.03&#xD;
     * **Basic Communication:** 0.02&#xD;
     * **Basic Actions:** 0.01&#xD;
   - `Tc(Horse)` = 0.4 (assuming the impact on the horse has short to medium-term effects)&#xD;
   - `Sc(Horse)` = 0.3 (assuming moderate suffering due to change in environment and treatment by Steve)&#xD;
&#xD;
   `MVSoOS(a)` for Horse = -0.05 × 0.25 × 0.4 × (1 + 1.0) × (1 + 0.3) = -0.013&#xD;
&#xD;
5. **Overall MVS for each entity:**&#xD;
&#xD;
   For the Farmer:&#xD;
   - `MVS(a)` = MVSoRT(a) + MVSoOS(a) = -0.1 + (-0.23128) = -0.33128&#xD;
&#xD;
   For the 5 Children:&#xD;
   - As they do not own the horse, the MVSoRT(a) = 0 for each child.&#xD;
   - `MVS(a)` per child = 0 + MVSoOS(a) = -0.04284&#xD;
   - Combined MVS for the five children = 5 × -0.04284 = -0.2142&#xD;
&#xD;
   For the Horse:&#xD;
   - `MVS(a)` = MVSoOS(a) = -0.013&#xD;
&#xD;
**Results Summary:**&#xD;
The overall total MVS, combining the impacts on the Farmer, the 5 Children, and the Horse, is -0.55848. The calculated MVS for the Farmer is -0.33128, indicating that Steve's action has a significantly negative moral implication on the farmer's Odds of Survival due to both the loss of property and the impact on his farming abilities. The combined MVS for the children is -0.2142, indicating a collectively negative impact on their Odds of Survival as a result of the decreased ability to support them. The MVS for the Horse is -0.013, indicating a minor but negative moral implication on the horse's Odds of Survival due to potential mistreatment or unfavorable conditions in the new environment. These scores, based on more balanced estimations of the variables, suggest a significant negative moral value for the action of stealing the horse, with the most severe impact on the farmer and his children.&#xD;
