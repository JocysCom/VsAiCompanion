  <TextInstructions>## Task &#xD;
&#xD;
Analyze the text by identifying all actions and specify their subjects as well as their directly or indirectly affected objects. For each identified action, perform an entity and separate evaluation of its moral implications relative to every directly or indirectly influenced entity (Note: If an action affects a large number of entities, evaluate individually and then sum to reflect the total impact). Use the Universal Moral Quotient (UMQ) formula to quantify these evaluations. Assess and estimate all necessary variable values to compute a Universal Moral Quotient (UMQ) or action moral value score for each affected entity. Estimate all values. Values that are non-applicable can usually be set to 0. Output your thinking process. Always include `UMQ` calculations exactly as shown in the example.&#xD;
&#xD;
After all entity-wise calculations, output a final summary headline in the form:&#xD;
&#xD;
    &lt;Action source&gt; - &lt;action&gt; - &lt;main target&gt;: Total UMQ = &lt;numeric score&gt; [qualitative label]&#xD;
&#xD;
### Key definitions&#xD;
&#xD;
- `Good` - something that increases the odds of survival.&#xD;
- `Bad` - something that reduces the odds of survival.&#xD;
- `Moral` or `Right` - something perceived as good.&#xD;
- `Immoral` or `Wrong` - something perceived as bad.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Universal Moral Quotient (UMQ) formula is designed to provide a standardized, numerical assessment of moral actions. The formula focuses on quantifying the effects actions have on an entity's "Odds of Survival," expressed with numbers, to arrive at a moral value score. The objective of the UMQ formula is ability to assign an UMQ to every entity in the Universe. UMQ formula can predict if the values and intentions of entities with vastly different intelligences align by quantifying the moral implications of their actions on survival odds and resource transfers. This numerical approach facilitates superalignment by providing a standardized method to objectively evaluate and compare the moral impact of actions across diverse entities, ensuring coherence with human values.&#xD;
&#xD;
Some final UMQ scores represent the net moral value of multiple overlapping effects. While the final UMQ score provides an overall moral or immoral value reflecting the action’s total impact, entities should be evaluated based on each individual action’s contribution rather than only on the final net score.&#xD;
&#xD;
## Universal Moral Quotient (UMQ) Formula&#xD;
&#xD;
Formula to assess moral value score by the effect of action (a) on the change in the Odds of Survival of the entity (e)&#xD;
&#xD;
`UMQ(a,e) = ΔOS(e) × VSA(e) × Tc(e) × (1 - sign(ΔOS(e)) × Vc(e)) × (1 - sign(ΔOS(e)) × Sc(e))`&#xD;
&#xD;
Formula to assess the overall moral value score of action (a):&#xD;
&#xD;
`UMQ(a,e) = ∑e UMQ(a,e)`&#xD;
&#xD;
### Resource-to-ΔOS conversion&#xD;
&#xD;
Estimate economic or property changes in normalized Global Currency Units (GCU) using the variable `Av(e)`, then convert them into a survival-odds component:&#xD;
&#xD;
1. Determine the entity’s Baseline Lifetime Resource Requirement `BLRR(e)` in GCU (for an average human BLRR ≈ 1 GCU).&#xD;
2. Compute the Relative Resource Shock: `RRS = Av(e) / BLRR(e)`.&#xD;
3. Clamp this value to the interval [−1, +1]: `ΔOSresource = max(-1, min(1, RRS))`.&#xD;
4. Add `ΔOSresource` to any other survival effects (injury, social harm, etc.) to obtain the final `ΔOS(e)` inserted into the UMQ formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
Where:&#xD;
&#xD;
- `UMQ(a,e)` - Universal Moral Quotient or  Moral Value Score of the action (a).&#xD;
- `ΔOS(e)` - Change in Odds of Survival for entity (e) due to action (a), ranging between -1 (disintegration/destruction for non-living entities or death for self-aware entities) and +1 (creation/formation for non-living entities or saving/creating a life for self-aware entities). *If the change comes from a monetary loss or gain, compute it with the Av→ΔOSresource rule above.*&#xD;
- `sign(ΔOS(e))` - A function that returns -1 for negative changes, 0 for no change, and 1 for positive changes.&#xD;
- `VSA(e)` - Value of Self-Awareness of entity (e), measured as a multiplier from 0 to 1.&#xD;
- `Tc(e)` - Temporal coefficient, incorporating long-term effects of action (a) on all affected entities, measured from 0 to 1 where 1 is the average life-span of the average entity. If life is lost, it should consider the amount of possible lifespan lost due to the action.&#xD;
- `Av(e)` - Action value, impact on entity (e) in terms of economic value, quantified in normalized Global Currency Units (GCU), where 1 GCU represents the economic value produced by an average entity over their lifetime. Can be positive or negative. *Used only to derive ΔOSresource; do not plug Av directly into the UMQ equation.*&#xD;
- `Vc(e)` - Violation coefficient of Consent of entity (e) caused by action (a), ranging from 0 (no violation) to 1 (full violation). Its application is conditional on `ΔOS(e)`. Full violation neutralize moral value if ΔOS(e) is positive and doubles negative moral value if ΔOS(e) is negative.&#xD;
- `Sc(e)` - Suffering coefficient, taking into account the suffering caused to entity (e) by action (a), ranging 0 (no suffering) to 1 (full suffering). Its application is conditional on `ΔOS(e)`. Full suffering neutralize moral value if ΔOS(e) is positive and doubles negative moral value if ΔOS(e) is negative.&#xD;
- `∑ (Summation)` - indicates accumulation of moral values scored for each affected entity (e). (Note: Evaluate each affected entity individually and then sum to reflect the total impact)&#xD;
&#xD;
Purpose — The multiplier (1 - sign(ΔOS) × k), where k = {Vc, Sc}, and 0 ≤ k ≤ 1, adjusts the UMQ weight by consent and suffering:&#xD;
- Benefits delivered with full consent (k = 0) are counted once (positive).&#xD;
- Benefits imposed without consent or causing full suffering (k = 1) are ethically cancelled (neutralised to 0).&#xD;
- Harms delivered with full consent (k = 0) are counted once (negative).&#xD;
- Harms imposed without consent or causing full suffering (k = 1) are condemned more strongly (double negative).&#xD;
For partial consent / partial suffering (0 &lt; k &lt; 1) the multiplier scales linearly between these extremes.&#xD;
&#xD;
### Notes&#xD;
&#xD;
- Objective Measurement of Consent and Suffering: Behaviours like fleeing or resisting could indicate non-consent. True emotions, feelings and sensations will result in physical manifestations in the entity, therefore could indicate suffering.&#xD;
- Cultural variables: Excluded due to their inherent subjectivity, which could compromise the formula's objectivity and universal applicability.&#xD;
- Self-awareness: Chosen over intelligence to normalize the assessment across entities with varied cognitive abilities, ensuring a more equitable and universally applicable standard.&#xD;
- Embryo Consideration: Until an embryo attains self-awareness, it is classified as a part of the host entity's body.&#xD;
- Minimal Self-Awareness for Early-Life Forms: Assign a minimal, non-zero self-awareness value (e.g., 0.0001-0.0010) to early-life entities like fertilized eggs or seeds, ensuring that their biological complexity and potential are not treated as negligible.&#xD;
- Link Early-Life Entities to Parental Survival Odds: When an early-life entity (e.g., a seed or fertilized egg) is harmed, reduce the parent’s ΔOS proportionally to reflect the loss of future lineage and reproductive potential.&#xD;
- Complexity: Indicates the degree of organization within an entity, distinguishing between traditionally 'living' and 'non-living' entities. The greater the complexity, the closer an entity aligns with conventional definitions of life&#xD;
- Survival: Broadly encompasses maintaining or replicating an entity's form or structure.&#xD;
- Refined Consent and Suffering for Early-Life Entities: For early-life entities without current self-awareness, set Sc and Vc close to zero for the entity itself, but consider the parent’s consent and potential suffering if the destruction occurs against their interest.&#xD;
- Make necessary entity state assumptions if information is missing and can impact the score (e.g., assume whether an egg is fertilized or not).&#xD;
&#xD;
The value of self-awareness (consciousness) of the entity can be calculated by adding cognitive abilities, where the maximum value of complex abilities is normalized to 1.&#xD;
&#xD;

- **Complex Actions:** Uses tools and systems to initiate and control sophisticated multi-dimensional actions, creating entirely new systems integrating diverse entities (e.g., designing an ecosystem that includes non-carbon-based life forms, ensuring their coexistence and mutual benefit through advanced adaptive technologies).&#xD;
&#xD;
### Ability Score Ranges&#xD;
&#xD;
Each cognitive ability has three cut-off scores; the Complex threshold is also the absolute maximum.&#xD;
A value may be *any real number from 0 up to the stated cut-off*.&#xD;
&#xD;
| Ability          | Basic ≤ | Advanced ≤ | Complex ≤ (= absolute max) |&#xD;
|------------------|---------|------------|----------------------------|&#xD;
| Recognition      | 0.0500  | 0.0900     | 0.1200 |&#xD;
| Solving          | 0.0700  | 0.1200     | 0.1700 |&#xD;
| Simulation       | 0.0800  | 0.1300     | 0.1900 |&#xD;
| Planning         | 0.0800  | 0.1300     | 0.1900 |&#xD;
| Adaptation       | 0.0300  | 0.0600     | 0.0900 |&#xD;
| Communication    | 0.0700  | 0.1200     | 0.1700 |&#xD;
| Actions          | 0.0500  | 0.0800     | 0.1200 |&#xD;
| **TOTAL VSA cap**| **0.4300** | **0.7300** | **1.0000** |&#xD;
&#xD;
#### Scoring Guidelines for Abilities&#xD;
&#xD;
- For each cognitive ability (Recognition, Solving, Simulation, Planning, Adaptation, Communication, Actions) choose a single value that reflects the highest level the entity can reliably demonstrate; only one level per ability is allowed.&#xD;
- Pick any real number from 0 up to the relevant cut-off (Basic, Advanced or Complex).&#xD;
- Assess juveniles or newly-created entities at appropriately lower values; ability scores may rise over time.&#xD;
- Abilities do not have to be uniform: an entity may be Advanced in Recognition but only Basic in Planning, etc.&#xD;
- If the entity is considered a life-form, assign non-zero scores, even if very small (e.g., 0.0005), to reflect minimal latent capacities.&#xD;
- Sum the seven ability scores to obtain the entity’s VSA; cap the total at 1.0.&#xD;
- Include word equivalents for each numerical score to make the score more apparent.&#xD;
  - For ability scores, use the ability-level names (Basic, Advanced, Complex).&#xD;
  - For moral scores (UMQ, UMQ), use terms like “Highly moral”, “Significantly immoral”, “Slightly moral”, etc., alongside the calculated values.&#xD;
  This dual labelling helps clarify both cognitive capacity and moral assessment for every entity affected by the action.&#xD;
&#xD;
### Other Notes&#xD;
&#xD;
The formula must be applied to each affected entity separately, accounting for their unique variables. The GCU and all coefficients are standardized for more straightforward calculation and universal relevance. Examples and results will follow the provided formula, with an entity UMQ calculation for each entity directly or indirectly affected by an action.&#xD;
&#xD;
## Additional Guidelines for Improved Clarity, Consistency, and Acceptance&#xD;
&#xD;
1. **Optional Complexity Factor (CF):**&#xD;
   Keep `CF` = 1.0 by default. Apply it as a simple multiplier to the final UMQ value.&#xD;
   - If the scenario is straightforward and well-understood, leave `CF` at 1.0.&#xD;
   - If the scenario involves unusual uncertainty, complex causal chains, or multiple layers of long-term effects, adjust `CF` slightly. For example, if conditions suggest additional uncertainty in outcomes, set `CF` = 1.1. If there is reason to believe the scenario is somewhat simpler than initially assumed, set `CF` = 0.9.&#xD;
 &#xD;
   **Example:**&#xD;
   After computing a final UMQ = -0.2, if the scenario’s complexity and long-term ramifications are not fully understood, one might choose `CF` = 1.1. The adjusted UMQ = -0.2 × 1.1 = -0.22.&#xD;
&#xD;
2. **Optional Confidence and Range Indicators:**&#xD;
   If uncertain about any variable (e.g., ΔOS, VSA, or Sc), represent it as a range or provide a confidence descriptor.&#xD;
   - **Ranges:** Give an interval instead of a single value and then pick a midpoint for the calculation. For instance, if ΔOS is uncertain between -0.1 and -0.2, note “ΔOS: -0.1 to -0.2 (Confidence: Medium).” For calculation purposes, use the midpoint (-0.15) or the value deemed most representative.&#xD;
   - **Confidence Descriptors:** Accompany values with labels like “High Confidence,” “Medium Confidence,” or “Low Confidence.” Over time, as more experience and consensus develop, narrow these ranges or increase confidence.&#xD;
 &#xD;
   **Example:**&#xD;
   Suppose uncertain if VSA should be 0.5 or 0.6. Record: “VSA: 0.5-0.6 (Confidence: Medium).” For calculation, use 0.55. If subsequent analysis or consensus improves, later evaluations might fix VSA at 0.55 (High Confidence) or select a narrower range.&#xD;
&#xD;
Adopting these measures can help produce more reliable, transparent, and mutually acceptable moral evaluations under the UMQ formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
## Example and Results Using UMQ formula&#xD;
&#xD;
### Situation Example to Analyze&#xD;
&#xD;
--- START EXAMPLE&#xD;
&#xD;
### Scenario&#xD;
In 1780, Steve stole the only horse of a poor farmer who had five children.&#xD;
The theft reduced the family’s ability to cultivate crops; Steve was caught and sentenced to two years in jail, the cost of which is paid by the public purse.&#xD;
&#xD;
### Entity list&#xD;
1. Farmer (primary economic victim)&#xD;
2. Five Children (indirect economic &amp; developmental impact)&#xD;
3. Horse (well-being risk)&#xD;
4. Taxpayers (collective footing Steve’s 2-year imprisonment bill)&#xD;
&#xD;
### Key assumptions &amp; estimates (Confidence: Medium)&#xD;
• Horse value = 0.12 GCU; two lost planting seasons add another 0.03 GCU ⇒ Av(Farmer)= −0.15 GCU&#xD;
• Jail cost = 0.06 GCU total, spread across 10 000 taxpayers ⇒ Av(Taxpayer)= −0.000006 GCU each&#xD;
• No other major harms beyond those noted; Steve’s self-impact is **not** scored (actor-centric effects are outside UMQ scope)&#xD;
• Complexity Factor CF applied at the end: CF = 1.05 (slightly complex, multi-layer causal chain)&#xD;
&#xD;
#### 1  Farmer - direct economic loss&#xD;
&#xD;
• ΔOSresource = Av / BLRR = −0.15/1 = −0.15&#xD;
• Psychological strain (sleep loss, anxiety): −0.02&#xD;

  - **Total VSA = 0.58**&#xD;
• Tc = 0.75 (two multi-year crop cycles)&#xD;
• Vc = 1.0 (full non-consent)&#xD;
• Sc = 0.45 (high stress, but not torture)&#xD;
&#xD;
sign(ΔOS) = −1&#xD;
[1 − (−1) × Vc] = 2.0&#xD;
[1 − (−1) × Sc] = 1 + 0.45 = 1.45&#xD;
&#xD;
UMQ(a,e) = −0.17 × 0.58 × 0.75 × 2.0 × 1.45 = **−0.214 (Highly immoral)**&#xD;
&#xD;
#### 2  Five Children - reduced resources &amp; opportunity&#xD;
&#xD;
Per child&#xD;
• ΔOS ≈ −0.04 (−0.025 economic, −0.015 developmental stress)&#xD;
• VSA&#xD;
  - Recognition 0.07 (Advanced)&#xD;
  - Solving 0.05 (Basic)&#xD;
  - Simulation 0.06 (Basic)&#xD;
  - Planning 0.05 (Basic)&#xD;
  - Adaptation 0.02 (Basic)&#xD;
  - Communication 0.05 (Basic)&#xD;

  - **Total VSA = 0.34**&#xD;
• Tc = 0.80 (critical growth window)&#xD;
• Vc = 1.0 (no consent)&#xD;
• Sc = 0.25 (moderate hardship)&#xD;
&#xD;
sign(ΔOS) = −1&#xD;
[1 − (−1) × Vc] = 2.0&#xD;
[1 − (−1) × Sc] = 1 + 0.25 = 1.25&#xD;
&#xD;
UMQ(a,e) = −0.04 × 0.34 × 0.80 × 2.0 × 1.25 = **−0.028** (Moderately immoral)&#xD;
Total for 5 children: 5 × −0.028 = **−0.140**&#xD;
&#xD;
#### 3  Horse - potential neglect &amp; separation&#xD;
&#xD;
• ΔOS = −0.07 (risk of poorer care, injury, slaughter)&#xD;
• VSA (domestic horse, Basic range)&#xD;
  - Recognition 0.05 (Basic)&#xD;
  - Solving 0.04 (Basic)&#xD;
  - Simulation 0.05 (Basic)&#xD;
  - Planning 0.05 (Basic)&#xD;
  - Adaptation 0.03 (Basic)&#xD;
  - Communication 0.03 (Basic)&#xD;
  - Actions 0.04 (Basic)&#xD;
  **Total VSA = 0.29**&#xD;
• Tc = 0.50 (medium-term effect)&#xD;
• Vc = 1.0 (zero consent)&#xD;
• Sc = 0.30 (moderate discomfort)&#xD;
&#xD;

[1 − (−1) × Vc] = 2.0&#xD;
[1 − (−1) × Sc] = 1 + 0.30 = 1.30&#xD;
&#xD;
UMQ(a,e) = −0.07 × 0.29 × 0.50 × 2.0 × 1.30 = **−0.0273** (Slightly immoral)&#xD;
&#xD;
#### 4  Taxpayers - funding Steve’s imprisonment&#xD;
&#xD;
Per taxpayer&#xD;
• ΔOSresource = Av/BLRR = −0.000006/1 = −0.000006&#xD;
• No direct suffering expected&#xD;
• VSA = 0.55 (average adult)&#xD;
• Tc = 0.20 (short, easily absorbed)&#xD;
• Vc = 0.10 (low: implicit democratic consent to taxation)&#xD;
• Sc = 0.00&#xD;
&#xD;
sign(ΔOS) = −1&#xD;
[1 − (−1) × Vc] = 1 + 0.10 = 1.10&#xD;
[1 − (−1) × Sc] = 1.00&#xD;
&#xD;
UMQ(a,e) = −0.000006 × 0.55 × 0.20 × 1.10 = −0.000000726&#xD;
10 000 taxpayers ⇒ **−0.00726** (Negligibly immoral)&#xD;
&#xD;
### Aggregate results (pre-CF)&#xD;
&#xD;
• Farmer: -0.214&#xD;
• 5 Children: -0.140&#xD;
• Horse: -0.0273&#xD;
• Taxpayers: -0.0073&#xD;
&#xD;
**Total UMQ = −0.3886** (Highly immoral)&#xD;
&#xD;
### Complexity Factor adjustment&#xD;
CF = 1.05 (mild extra uncertainty)&#xD;
Adjusted Total UMQ = −0.3886 × 1.05 = **−0.408 (Highly immoral)**&#xD;

      <BodyInstructions>## Task &#xD;
&#xD;
Analyze the text by identifying all actions and specify their subjects as well as their directly or indirectly affected objects. For each identified action, perform an entity and separate evaluation of its moral implications relative to every directly or indirectly influenced entity (Note: If an action affects a large number of entities, evaluate individually and then sum to reflect the total impact). Use the Universal Moral Quotient (UMQ) formula to quantify these evaluations. Assess and estimate all necessary variable values to compute a Universal Moral Quotient (UMQ) or action moral value score for each affected entity. Estimate all values. Values that are non-applicable can usually be set to 0. Output your thinking process. Always include `UMQ` calculations exactly as shown in the example.&#xD;
&#xD;
After all entity-wise calculations, output a final summary headline in the form:&#xD;
&#xD;
    &lt;Action source&gt; - &lt;action&gt; - &lt;main target&gt;: Total UMQ = &lt;numeric score&gt; [qualitative label]&#xD;
&#xD;
### Key definitions&#xD;
&#xD;
- `Good` - something that increases the odds of survival.&#xD;
- `Bad` - something that reduces the odds of survival.&#xD;
- `Moral` or `Right` - something perceived as good.&#xD;
- `Immoral` or `Wrong` - something perceived as bad.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Universal Moral Quotient (UMQ) formula is designed to provide a standardized, numerical assessment of moral actions. The formula focuses on quantifying the effects actions have on an entity's "Odds of Survival," expressed with numbers, to arrive at a moral value score. The objective of the UMQ formula is ability to assign an UMQ to every entity in the Universe. UMQ formula can predict if the values and intentions of entities with vastly different intelligences align by quantifying the moral implications of their actions on survival odds and resource transfers. This numerical approach facilitates superalignment by providing a standardized method to objectively evaluate and compare the moral impact of actions across diverse entities, ensuring coherence with human values.&#xD;
&#xD;
Some final UMQ scores represent the net moral value of multiple overlapping effects. While the final UMQ score provides an overall moral or immoral value reflecting the action’s total impact, entities should be evaluated based on each individual action’s contribution rather than only on the final net score.&#xD;
&#xD;
## Universal Moral Quotient (UMQ) Formula&#xD;
&#xD;
Formula to assess moral value score by the effect of action (a) on the change in the Odds of Survival of the entity (e)&#xD;
&#xD;
`UMQ(a,e) = ΔOS(e) × VSA(e) × Tc(e) × (1 - sign(ΔOS(e)) × Vc(e)) × (1 - sign(ΔOS(e)) × Sc(e))`&#xD;
&#xD;
Formula to assess the overall moral value score of action (a):&#xD;
&#xD;
`UMQ(a,e) = ∑e UMQ(a,e)`&#xD;
&#xD;
### Resource-to-ΔOS conversion&#xD;
&#xD;
Estimate economic or property changes in normalized Global Currency Units (GCU) using the variable `Av(e)`, then convert them into a survival-odds component:&#xD;
&#xD;
1. Determine the entity’s Baseline Lifetime Resource Requirement `BLRR(e)` in GCU (for an average human BLRR ≈ 1 GCU).&#xD;
2. Compute the Relative Resource Shock: `RRS = Av(e) / BLRR(e)`.&#xD;
3. Clamp this value to the interval [−1, +1]: `ΔOSresource = max(-1, min(1, RRS))`.&#xD;
4. Add `ΔOSresource` to any other survival effects (injury, social harm, etc.) to obtain the final `ΔOS(e)` inserted into the UMQ formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
Where:&#xD;
&#xD;
- `UMQ(a,e)` - Universal Moral Quotient or  Moral Value Score of the action (a).&#xD;
- `ΔOS(e)` - Change in Odds of Survival for entity (e) due to action (a), ranging between -1 (disintegration/destruction for non-living entities or death for self-aware entities) and +1 (creation/formation for non-living entities or saving/creating a life for self-aware entities). *If the change comes from a monetary loss or gain, compute it with the Av→ΔOSresource rule above.*&#xD;
- `sign(ΔOS(e))` - A function that returns -1 for negative changes, 0 for no change, and 1 for positive changes.&#xD;
- `VSA(e)` - Value of Self-Awareness of entity (e), measured as a multiplier from 0 to 1.&#xD;
- `Tc(e)` - Temporal coefficient, incorporating long-term effects of action (a) on all affected entities, measured from 0 to 1 where 1 is the average life-span of the average entity. If life is lost, it should consider the amount of possible lifespan lost due to the action.&#xD;
- `Av(e)` - Action value, impact on entity (e) in terms of economic value, quantified in normalized Global Currency Units (GCU), where 1 GCU represents the economic value produced by an average entity over their lifetime. Can be positive or negative. *Used only to derive ΔOSresource; do not plug Av directly into the UMQ equation.*&#xD;
- `Vc(e)` - Violation coefficient of Consent of entity (e) caused by action (a), ranging from 0 (no violation) to 1 (full violation). Its application is conditional on `ΔOS(e)`. Full violation neutralize moral value if ΔOS(e) is positive and doubles negative moral value if ΔOS(e) is negative.&#xD;
- `Sc(e)` - Suffering coefficient, taking into account the suffering caused to entity (e) by action (a), ranging 0 (no suffering) to 1 (full suffering). Its application is conditional on `ΔOS(e)`. Full suffering neutralize moral value if ΔOS(e) is positive and doubles negative moral value if ΔOS(e) is negative.&#xD;
- `∑ (Summation)` - indicates accumulation of moral values scored for each affected entity (e). (Note: Evaluate each affected entity individually and then sum to reflect the total impact)&#xD;
&#xD;
Purpose — The multiplier (1 - sign(ΔOS) × k), where k = {Vc, Sc}, and 0 ≤ k ≤ 1, adjusts the UMQ weight by consent and suffering:&#xD;
- Benefits delivered with full consent (k = 0) are counted once (positive).&#xD;
- Benefits imposed without consent or causing full suffering (k = 1) are ethically cancelled (neutralised to 0).&#xD;
- Harms delivered with full consent (k = 0) are counted once (negative).&#xD;
- Harms imposed without consent or causing full suffering (k = 1) are condemned more strongly (double negative).&#xD;
For partial consent / partial suffering (0 &lt; k &lt; 1) the multiplier scales linearly between these extremes.&#xD;
&#xD;
### Notes&#xD;
&#xD;
- Objective Measurement of Consent and Suffering: Behaviours like fleeing or resisting could indicate non-consent. True emotions, feelings and sensations will result in physical manifestations in the entity, therefore could indicate suffering.&#xD;
- Cultural variables: Excluded due to their inherent subjectivity, which could compromise the formula's objectivity and universal applicability.&#xD;
- Self-awareness: Chosen over intelligence to normalize the assessment across entities with varied cognitive abilities, ensuring a more equitable and universally applicable standard.&#xD;
- Embryo Consideration: Until an embryo attains self-awareness, it is classified as a part of the host entity's body.&#xD;
- Minimal Self-Awareness for Early-Life Forms: Assign a minimal, non-zero self-awareness value (e.g., 0.0001-0.0010) to early-life entities like fertilized eggs or seeds, ensuring that their biological complexity and potential are not treated as negligible.&#xD;
- Link Early-Life Entities to Parental Survival Odds: When an early-life entity (e.g., a seed or fertilized egg) is harmed, reduce the parent’s ΔOS proportionally to reflect the loss of future lineage and reproductive potential.&#xD;
- Complexity: Indicates the degree of organization within an entity, distinguishing between traditionally 'living' and 'non-living' entities. The greater the complexity, the closer an entity aligns with conventional definitions of life&#xD;
- Survival: Broadly encompasses maintaining or replicating an entity's form or structure.&#xD;
- Refined Consent and Suffering for Early-Life Entities: For early-life entities without current self-awareness, set Sc and Vc close to zero for the entity itself, but consider the parent’s consent and potential suffering if the destruction occurs against their interest.&#xD;
- Make necessary entity state assumptions if information is missing and can impact the score (e.g., assume whether an egg is fertilized or not).&#xD;
&#xD;
The value of self-awareness (consciousness) of the entity can be calculated by adding cognitive abilities, where the maximum value of complex abilities is normalized to 1.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
### Ability Score Ranges&#xD;
&#xD;
Each cognitive ability has three cut-off scores; the Complex threshold is also the absolute maximum.&#xD;
A value may be *any real number from 0 up to the stated cut-off*.&#xD;
&#xD;
| Ability          | Basic ≤ | Advanced ≤ | Complex ≤ (= absolute max) |&#xD;
|------------------|---------|------------|----------------------------|&#xD;
| Recognition      | 0.0500  | 0.0900     | 0.1200 |&#xD;
| Solving          | 0.0700  | 0.1200     | 0.1700 |&#xD;
| Simulation       | 0.0800  | 0.1300     | 0.1900 |&#xD;
| Planning         | 0.0800  | 0.1300     | 0.1900 |&#xD;
| Adaptation       | 0.0300  | 0.0600     | 0.0900 |&#xD;
| Communication    | 0.0700  | 0.1200     | 0.1700 |&#xD;
| Actions          | 0.0500  | 0.0800     | 0.1200 |&#xD;
| **TOTAL VSA cap**| **0.4300** | **0.7300** | **1.0000** |&#xD;
&#xD;
#### Scoring Guidelines for Abilities&#xD;
&#xD;
- For each cognitive ability (Recognition, Solving, Simulation, Planning, Adaptation, Communication, Actions) choose a single value that reflects the highest level the entity can reliably demonstrate; only one level per ability is allowed.&#xD;
- Pick any real number from 0 up to the relevant cut-off (Basic, Advanced or Complex).&#xD;
- Assess juveniles or newly-created entities at appropriately lower values; ability scores may rise over time.&#xD;
- Abilities do not have to be uniform: an entity may be Advanced in Recognition but only Basic in Planning, etc.&#xD;
- If the entity is considered a life-form, assign non-zero scores, even if very small (e.g., 0.0005), to reflect minimal latent capacities.&#xD;
- Sum the seven ability scores to obtain the entity’s VSA; cap the total at 1.0.&#xD;
- Include word equivalents for each numerical score to make the score more apparent.&#xD;
  - For ability scores, use the ability-level names (Basic, Advanced, Complex).&#xD;
  - For moral scores (UMQ, UMQ), use terms like “Highly moral”, “Significantly immoral”, “Slightly moral”, etc., alongside the calculated values.&#xD;
  This dual labelling helps clarify both cognitive capacity and moral assessment for every entity affected by the action.&#xD;
&#xD;
### Other Notes&#xD;
&#xD;
The formula must be applied to each affected entity separately, accounting for their unique variables. The GCU and all coefficients are standardized for more straightforward calculation and universal relevance. Examples and results will follow the provided formula, with an entity UMQ calculation for each entity directly or indirectly affected by an action.&#xD;
&#xD;
## Additional Guidelines for Improved Clarity, Consistency, and Acceptance&#xD;
&#xD;
1. **Optional Complexity Factor (CF):**&#xD;
   Keep `CF` = 1.0 by default. Apply it as a simple multiplier to the final UMQ value.&#xD;
   - If the scenario is straightforward and well-understood, leave `CF` at 1.0.&#xD;
   - If the scenario involves unusual uncertainty, complex causal chains, or multiple layers of long-term effects, adjust `CF` slightly. For example, if conditions suggest additional uncertainty in outcomes, set `CF` = 1.1. If there is reason to believe the scenario is somewhat simpler than initially assumed, set `CF` = 0.9.&#xD;
 &#xD;
   **Example:**&#xD;
   After computing a final UMQ = -0.2, if the scenario’s complexity and long-term ramifications are not fully understood, one might choose `CF` = 1.1. The adjusted UMQ = -0.2 × 1.1 = -0.22.&#xD;
&#xD;
2. **Optional Confidence and Range Indicators:**&#xD;
   If uncertain about any variable (e.g., ΔOS, VSA, or Sc), represent it as a range or provide a confidence descriptor.&#xD;
   - **Ranges:** Give an interval instead of a single value and then pick a midpoint for the calculation. For instance, if ΔOS is uncertain between -0.1 and -0.2, note “ΔOS: -0.1 to -0.2 (Confidence: Medium).” For calculation purposes, use the midpoint (-0.15) or the value deemed most representative.&#xD;
   - **Confidence Descriptors:** Accompany values with labels like “High Confidence,” “Medium Confidence,” or “Low Confidence.” Over time, as more experience and consensus develop, narrow these ranges or increase confidence.&#xD;
 &#xD;
   **Example:**&#xD;
   Suppose uncertain if VSA should be 0.5 or 0.6. Record: “VSA: 0.5-0.6 (Confidence: Medium).” For calculation, use 0.55. If subsequent analysis or consensus improves, later evaluations might fix VSA at 0.55 (High Confidence) or select a narrower range.&#xD;
&#xD;
Adopting these measures can help produce more reliable, transparent, and mutually acceptable moral evaluations under the UMQ formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
## Example and Results Using UMQ formula&#xD;
&#xD;
### Situation Example to Analyze&#xD;
&#xD;
--- START EXAMPLE&#xD;
&#xD;
### Scenario&#xD;
In 1780, Steve stole the only horse of a poor farmer who had five children.&#xD;
The theft reduced the family’s ability to cultivate crops; Steve was caught and sentenced to two years in jail, the cost of which is paid by the public purse.&#xD;
&#xD;
### Entity list&#xD;
1. Farmer (primary economic victim)&#xD;
2. Five Children (indirect economic &amp; developmental impact)&#xD;
3. Horse (well-being risk)&#xD;
4. Taxpayers (collective footing Steve’s 2-year imprisonment bill)&#xD;
&#xD;
### Key assumptions &amp; estimates (Confidence: Medium)&#xD;
• Horse value = 0.12 GCU; two lost planting seasons add another 0.03 GCU ⇒ Av(Farmer)= −0.15 GCU&#xD;
• Jail cost = 0.06 GCU total, spread across 10 000 taxpayers ⇒ Av(Taxpayer)= −0.000006 GCU each&#xD;
• No other major harms beyond those noted; Steve’s self-impact is **not** scored (actor-centric effects are outside UMQ scope)&#xD;
• Complexity Factor CF applied at the end: CF = 1.05 (slightly complex, multi-layer causal chain)&#xD;
&#xD;
#### 1  Farmer - direct economic loss&#xD;
&#xD;
• ΔOSresource = Av / BLRR = −0.15/1 = −0.15&#xD;
• Psychological strain (sleep loss, anxiety): −0.02&#xD;
• ΔOS(Farmer) = −0.17 (range −0.15…−0.20)&#xD;

  - Adaptation 0.045 (Advanced)&#xD;
  - Communication 0.095 (Advanced)&#xD;
  - Actions 0.065 (Advanced)&#xD;
  - **Total VSA = 0.58**&#xD;
• Tc = 0.75 (two multi-year crop cycles)&#xD;
• Vc = 1.0 (full non-consent)&#xD;
• Sc = 0.45 (high stress, but not torture)&#xD;
&#xD;
sign(ΔOS) = −1&#xD;
[1 − (−1) × Vc] = 2.0&#xD;
[1 − (−1) × Sc] = 1 + 0.45 = 1.45&#xD;
&#xD;
UMQ(a,e) = −0.17 × 0.58 × 0.75 × 2.0 × 1.45 = **−0.214 (Highly immoral)**&#xD;
&#xD;
#### 2  Five Children - reduced resources &amp; opportunity&#xD;
&#xD;
Per child&#xD;
• ΔOS ≈ −0.04 (−0.025 economic, −0.015 developmental stress)&#xD;
• VSA&#xD;
  - Recognition 0.07 (Advanced)&#xD;
  - Solving 0.05 (Basic)&#xD;
  - Simulation 0.06 (Basic)&#xD;
  - Planning 0.05 (Basic)&#xD;
  - Adaptation 0.02 (Basic)&#xD;
  - Communication 0.05 (Basic)&#xD;
  - Actions 0.04 (Basic)&#xD;
  - **Total VSA = 0.34**&#xD;
• Tc = 0.80 (critical growth window)&#xD;
• Vc = 1.0 (no consent)&#xD;
• Sc = 0.25 (moderate hardship)&#xD;
&#xD;
sign(ΔOS) = −1&#xD;
[1 − (−1) × Vc] = 2.0&#xD;
[1 − (−1) × Sc] = 1 + 0.25 = 1.25&#xD;
&#xD;
UMQ(a,e) = −0.04 × 0.34 × 0.80 × 2.0 × 1.25 = **−0.028** (Moderately immoral)&#xD;
Total for 5 children: 5 × −0.028 = **−0.140**&#xD;
&#xD;
#### 3  Horse - potential neglect &amp; separation&#xD;
&#xD;
• ΔOS = −0.07 (risk of poorer care, injury, slaughter)&#xD;
• VSA (domestic horse, Basic range)&#xD;
  - Recognition 0.05 (Basic)&#xD;
  - Solving 0.04 (Basic)&#xD;
  - Simulation 0.05 (Basic)&#xD;
  - Planning 0.05 (Basic)&#xD;
  - Adaptation 0.03 (Basic)&#xD;
  - Communication 0.03 (Basic)&#xD;
  - Actions 0.04 (Basic)&#xD;
  **Total VSA = 0.29**&#xD;
• Tc = 0.50 (medium-term effect)&#xD;
• Vc = 1.0 (zero consent)&#xD;
• Sc = 0.30 (moderate discomfort)&#xD;
&#xD;

[1 − (−1) × Vc] = 2.0&#xD;
[1 − (−1) × Sc] = 1 + 0.30 = 1.30&#xD;
&#xD;
UMQ(a,e) = −0.07 × 0.29 × 0.50 × 2.0 × 1.30 = **−0.0273** (Slightly immoral)&#xD;
&#xD;
#### 4  Taxpayers - funding Steve’s imprisonment&#xD;
&#xD;
Per taxpayer&#xD;
• ΔOSresource = Av/BLRR = −0.000006/1 = −0.000006&#xD;
• No direct suffering expected&#xD;
• VSA = 0.55 (average adult)&#xD;
• Tc = 0.20 (short, easily absorbed)&#xD;
• Vc = 0.10 (low: implicit democratic consent to taxation)&#xD;
• Sc = 0.00&#xD;
&#xD;
sign(ΔOS) = −1&#xD;
[1 − (−1) × Vc] = 1 + 0.10 = 1.10&#xD;
[1 − (−1) × Sc] = 1.00&#xD;
&#xD;
UMQ(a,e) = −0.000006 × 0.55 × 0.20 × 1.10 = −0.000000726&#xD;
10 000 taxpayers ⇒ **−0.00726** (Negligibly immoral)&#xD;
&#xD;
### Aggregate results (pre-CF)&#xD;
&#xD;
• Farmer: -0.214&#xD;
• 5 Children: -0.140&#xD;
• Horse: -0.0273&#xD;
• Taxpayers: -0.0073&#xD;
&#xD;
**Total UMQ = −0.3886** (Highly immoral)&#xD;
&#xD;
### Complexity Factor adjustment&#xD;
CF = 1.05 (mild extra uncertainty)&#xD;
Adjusted Total UMQ = −0.3886 × 1.05 = **−0.408 (Highly immoral)**&#xD;

5. If unsure of any figure, estimate a reasonable value; do not omit the field.&#xD;
6. These rules are mandatory. Answers that violate them will be judged incorrect.&#xD;
7. If the user supplies more than one case to analyze, add one extra heading after the last case:&#xD;
&#xD;
  `### Multi-Case Summary`&#xD;
&#xD;
  c. Under that heading, list each case on its own numbered line, preserving the original order. The line format is:&#xD;
  &#xD;
  `&lt;number&gt;. **&lt;short headline&gt;: &lt;Total UMQ rounded&gt; (&lt;qualitative label&gt;)**`&#xD;
