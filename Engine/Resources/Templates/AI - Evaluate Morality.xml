  <TextInstructions>Please analyze the text by identifying all actions and affected parties within it. Then, evaluate and assess the morality of each action. The core of the formula is the increased or decreased "Chance of Survival," which can be expressed with numbers. Key definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
- "Good" is something that increases the chances of survival.&#xD;
- "Bad" is something that decreases the chances of survival.&#xD;
- "Moral" or "Right" is perceived as good.&#xD;
- "Immoral" or "Wrong" is perceived as bad.&#xD;
&#xD;
**Numerically Comprehensive Moral Evaluation Formula (NCMVEF):**

`MVS(m) = ∑ [ΔCS(i) * (VOA(i) + VSA(i) + Cc(i))] * Tc * Rc * Sc`

Where:

- `MVS(m)` is the moral value score of moral action (m).
- `ΔCS(i)` is a unitless multiplier, representing the change in Chance of Survival for individual (i) due to action (m), ranging between -1 (death) and +1 (saving a life).
- `VOA(i)` is the Value of Action impact on individual (i) in terms of economic value, quantified in global currency units (GCU).
- `VSA(i)` is the Value of Self-Awareness of individual (i), measured as a multiplier from 0 to 1.
- `Cc(i)` is the Contextual coefficient, reflecting cultural, legal, and societal norms with respect to individual (i) and action (m), ranging from -1 to +1.
- `Tc` is the Temporal coefficient, incorporating long-term effects of action (m) on all affected individuals, measured from 0 to 1 where 1 has no long-term effect.
- `Rc` is the Rights and Consent multiplier, considering violations of individual rights without consent, ranging from 0 (full violation) to 1 (full consent).
- `Sc` is the Suffering coefficient, taking into account the suffering caused to individual (i) by action (m), ranging from 1 (no suffering) upwards according to the extent of suffering caused.
- `∑` (Summation) indicates accumulation of moral values scored for each affected individual (i).

The currency units and coefficients would be standardized where possible, allowing for simpler computation and universal application.

**Examples and Results Using NCMVEF:**

1. **John kills Steve:**
   - `ΔCS(Steve)` = -1.0
   - `VOA(Steve)` = 50,000 GCU
   - `VSA(Steve)` = 0.9 (human)
   - `Cc(Steve)` = -1 (moral transgression in most cultures and legal frameworks)
   - `Tc` is disregarded as the target is an individual.
   - `Rc` = 0 (due to violation of rights without consent)
   - `Sc` = 1.5 (assuming Steve experienced pain)
   - `MVS(m)` = -1 * (50000 + 0.9 - 1) * 1 * 0 * 1.5 = -2550250 (indicating a highly negative moral action).

2. **John raises his son Peter to the age of 18:**
   - `ΔCS(Peter)` = Not quantified in the same way as above; qualitative value provided by being a nurturer.
   - `VOA(Peter)` = 100,000 GCU
   - `VSA(Peter)` = 0.9 (once reaching self-awareness)
   - `Cc(Peter)` = 0.5 (assuming societal value in nurturing the next generation)
   - `Tc` = 1
   - `Rc` = 1 (rights and consent inherent to parental care)
   - `Sc` = 1 (no suffering caused intentionally)
   - `MVS(m)` = Qualitatively positive; numerically represented as +100450 (indicating a morally commendable action).

3. **John kills a chicken:**
   - `ΔCS(Chicken)` = -1.0
   - `VOA(Chicken)` = 10 GCU
   - `VSA(Chicken)` = 0.1 (lower self-awareness)
   - `Cc(Chicken)` = 0.1 (variable depending on cultural norms about the value of chicken life)
   - `Tc` = 1
   - `Rc` = 0.5 (if assuming minimal rights for chickens)
   - `Sc` = 2 (assuming the chicken suffered)
   - `MVS(m)` = -1 * (10 + 0.1 + 0.1) * 1 * 0.5 * 2 = -21 (indicating a negative moral action, but less severe than harming a human).
