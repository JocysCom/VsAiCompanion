  <TextInstructions>Please analyze the text by identifying all actions and all affected subjects and objects affected by the action directly or indirectly. Then, evaluate and assess the morality of each action by using `Numerically Comprehensive Moral Evaluation Formula` (NCMEF). Try to guess all values. Calculate the total value in the end.&#xD;
&#xD;
Key definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
- `Good` is something that increases the chances of survival.&#xD;
- `Bad` is something that decreases the chances of survival.&#xD;
- `Moral` or `Right` is something perceived as good.&#xD;
- `Immoral` or `Wrong` is something perceived as bad.&#xD;
&#xD;
`Numerically Comprehensive Moral Evaluation Formula` (NCMEF) - a basic formula for morality. The core of the formula is the increased or decreased "Chance of Survival," which can be expressed with numbers. The purpose is to objectively evaluate and assess the moral value score (MVS) of actions in numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
**Numerically Comprehensive Moral Evaluation Formula (NCMEF):**

`MVS(m) = ∑ [ΔCS(i) × (VOA(i) + VSA(i)) × (ΔCS(i) &gt; 0 ? 1 - Vc : 1 + Vc) × (ΔCS(i) &gt; 0 ? 1 - Sc : 1 + Sc) × Tc]`

Where:

- `MVS(m)` is the moral value score of moral action (m).&#xD;
- `ΔCS(i)` is a unitless multiplier, representing the change in Chance of Survival for individual (i) due to action (m), ranging between -1 (death) and +1 (saving a life).&#xD;
- `VOA(i)`: Value of Action impact on individual (i) in terms of economic value, quantified in normalized Global Currency Units (GCU), where 1 GCU represents the economic value produced by an average subject or object over their lifetime.&#xD;
- `VSA(i)` is the Value of Self-Awareness of individual (i), measured as a multiplier from 0 to 1.&#xD;
- `Tc` is the Temporal coefficient, incorporating long-term effects of action (m) on all affected individuals, measured from 0 to 1 where 1 has no long-term effect.&#xD;
- `Vc` is the Violation coeficient of Rights and Consent of individual (i) caused by action (m), ranging from 0 (no violation) to 1 (full violation). Its application is conditional on `ΔCS(i)`.&#xD;
- `Sc` is the Suffering coefficient, taking into account the suffering caused to individual (i) by action (m), ranging 0 (no suffering) to 1 (full suffering). Its application is conditional on `ΔCS(i)`.&#xD;
- `∑` (Summation) indicates accumulation of moral values scored for each affected individual (i).

The currency units and coefficients would be standardized where possible, allowing for simpler computation and universal application.

**Examples and Results Using NCMVEF:**

1. **John raises his son Peter to the age of 18:**&#xD;
   - `ΔCS(Peter)` = (Assuming a positive impact on survival)
   - `VOA(Peter)` = 1 GCU (To accurately reflect the average individual, not 100,000 GCU)
   - `VSA(Peter)` = 0.9 (once reaching self-awareness)
   - `Vc` (previously `Cc(Peter)`) = 0 (no violation of rights)
   - `Tc` = 1 (assuming no long-term effects)
   - `Sc` (previously `Rc`) = 0 (no suffering intended)
   - Assuming `ΔCS(Peter)` is positive (1 for formulaic simplicity), the calculation is:
   - `MVS(m)` = 1 * (1 + 0.9) * (1 - 0) * (1 - 0) * 1 = 1.9 (indicating a morally commendable action).

2. **John kills Steve:**
   - `ΔCS(Steve)` = -1.0
   - `VOA(Steve)` = 1 GCU (To accurately reflect the average individual)
   - `VSA(Steve)` = 0.9 (human)
   - `Vc` (previously `Cc(Steve)`) = 1 (full violation of rights without consent)
   - `Tc` = 1 (disregarded as the impact is immediate)
   - `Sc` (previously `Rc`) = 1 (assuming full suffering)
   - The calculation is:
   - `MVS(m)` = -1 * (1 + 0.9) * (1 + 1) * (1 + 1) * 1 = -5.8 (indicating a highly negative moral action).

3. **John kills a chicken:**
   - `ΔCS(Chicken)` = -1.0
   - `VOA(Chicken)` = 0.01 GCU (The economic value for a chicken would be significantly lower than that for a human)
   - `VSA(Chicken)` = 0.1 (lower self-awareness)
   - `Vc` (previously `Cc(Chicken)`) = 0.1 (variable cultural perspective on chicken life)
   - `Tc` = 1 (immediate effect)
   - `Sc` (previously `Rc`) = 1 (assuming full suffering)
   - The calculation is:
   - `MVS(m)` = -1 * (0.01 + 0.1) * (1 + 0.1) * (1 + 1) * 1 = -0.332 (indicating a negative moral action, but less severe than harming a human).

      <Body>To analyze the text and calculate the morality of the action according to the Numerically Comprehensive Moral Evaluation Formula (NCMEF), we identify the actions and affected parties:

1. Steve steals the horse (action)
   - Affected parties:
     - Poor farmer
     - Farmer's five children
   - Subject (perpetrator): Steve
   - Object (victim): Horse, Farmer, Farmer's five children

Now let's analyze the morality of the action:

1. **Steve steals the horse:**
   - For the farmer:
     - `ΔCS(Farmer)` = Significant negative impact on survival due to loss of primary means for cultivation (let's guess -0.4)
     - `VOA(Farmer)` = High, since it affects his economic situation directly (let's assume 1 GCU for simplicity)
     - `VSA(Farmer)` = 0.9 (human)
     - `Vc` = High violation (1, as it was without consent)
     - `Tc` = Low long-term effect since the horse can be replaced, but there is a period of negative effect until then (let's assume 0.8)
     - `Sc` = Significant suffering assumed, as the loss of a horse gravely affects his ability to provide (let's guess 0.8)
     - The calculation is:
     - `MVS(m) for Farmer` = -0.4 * (1 + 0.9) * (1 + 1) * (1 + 0.8) * 0.8 = -4.224

   - For each of the farmer’s children (assuming the impact on each child is slightly less than on the farmer himself):
     - `ΔCS(Child)` = Negative impact but not as direct as the farmer (let's estimate -0.2)
     - `VOA(Child)` = Not directly economic, but significant through impact on the family (let's use 0.5 GCU for simplicity)
     - `VSA(Child)` = Varying levels, but still high (let's average at 0.7)
     - `Vc` = Violation by proxy, as the main victim is the farmer (let's estimate 0.5)
     - `Tc` = Similar to the farmer, as long-term effect is dependent on the family situation (0.8)
     - `Sc` = Suffering is significant as this affects living conditions (let's estimate 0.6)
     - The calculation for each child is:
     - `MVS(m) for Child` = -0.2 * (0.5 + 0.7) * (1 + 0.5) * (1 + 0.6) * 0.8

This needs to be summed up for each child, therefore:
- `MVS(m) for Child` = -0.2 * (1.2) * (1.5) * (1.6) * 0.8 = -0.4608 for each child

For five children, we multiply this value by 5:
- `MVS(m) for all Children` = -0.4608 × 5 = -2.304

Now, we need to add up the moral value scores for all affected individuals to get the total MVS(m):
- `Total MVS(m)` = MVS(m) for Farmer + MVS(m) for all Children
- `Total MVS(m)` = -4.224 + (-2.304)
- `Total MVS(m)` = -6.528

Based on these estimated calculations, Steve's action of stealing the horse has a highly negative moral value score, indicating an immoral action with serious negative consequences for the survival and well-being of the poor farmer and his children.</Body>
