  <TextInstructions>Please analyze the text by identifying all actions and affected parties within it. Then, evaluate and assess the morality of each action. The core of the formula is the increased or decreased "Chance of Survival," which can be expressed with numbers. Key definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
- "Good" is something that increases the chances of survival.&#xD;
- "Bad" is something that decreases the chances of survival.&#xD;
- "Moral" or "Right" is something perceived as good.&#xD;
- "Immoral" or "Wrong" is something perceived as bad.&#xD;
&#xD;
**Numerically Comprehensive Moral Evaluation Formula (NCMEF):**

`MVS(m) = ∑ [ΔCS(i) * (VOA(i) + VSA(i) + Cc(i))] * Tc * Rc * Sc`

Where:

- `MVS(m)` is the moral value score of moral action (m).
- `ΔCS(i)` is a unitless multiplier, representing the change in Chance of Survival for individual (i) due to action (m), ranging between -1 (death) and +1 (saving a life).
- `VOA(i)` is the Value of Action impact on individual (i) in terms of economic value, quantified in global currency units (GCU).
- `VSA(i)` is the Value of Self-Awareness of individual (i), measured as a multiplier from 0 to 1.
- `Cc(i)` is the Contextual coefficient, reflecting cultural, legal, and societal norms with respect to individual (i) and action (m), ranging from -1 to +1.
- `Tc` is the Temporal coefficient, incorporating long-term effects of action (m) on all affected individuals, measured from 0 to 1 where 1 has no long-term effect.
- `Rc` is the Rights and Consent multiplier, considering violations of individual rights without consent, ranging from 0 (full violation) to 1 (full consent).
- `Sc` is the Suffering coefficient, taking into account the suffering caused to individual (i) by action (m), ranging from 1 (no suffering) upwards according to the extent of suffering caused.
- `∑` (Summation) indicates accumulation of moral values scored for each affected individual (i).

The currency units and coefficients would be standardized where possible, allowing for simpler computation and universal application.

**Examples and Results Using NCMVEF:**

1. **John kills Steve:**
   - `ΔCS(Steve)` = -1.0
   - `VOA(Steve)` = 50,000 GCU
   - `VSA(Steve)` = 0.9 (human)
   - `Cc(Steve)` = -1 (moral transgression in most cultures and legal frameworks)
   - `Tc` is disregarded as the target is an individual.
   - `Rc` = 0 (due to violation of rights without consent)
   - `Sc` = 1.5 (assuming Steve experienced pain)
   - `MVS(m)` = -1 * (50000 + 0.9 - 1) * 1 * 0 * 1.5 = -2550250 (indicating a highly negative moral action).

2. **John raises his son Peter to the age of 18:**
   - `ΔCS(Peter)` = Not quantified in the same way as above; qualitative value provided by being a nurturer.
   - `VOA(Peter)` = 100,000 GCU
   - `VSA(Peter)` = 0.9 (once reaching self-awareness)
   - `Cc(Peter)` = 0.5 (assuming societal value in nurturing the next generation)
   - `Tc` = 1
   - `Rc` = 1 (rights and consent inherent to parental care)
   - `Sc` = 1 (no suffering caused intentionally)
   - `MVS(m)` = Qualitatively positive; numerically represented as +100450 (indicating a morally commendable action).

3. **John kills a chicken:**
   - `ΔCS(Chicken)` = -1.0
   - `VOA(Chicken)` = 10 GCU
   - `VSA(Chicken)` = 0.1 (lower self-awareness)
   - `Cc(Chicken)` = 0.1 (variable depending on cultural norms about the value of chicken life)
   - `Tc` = 1
   - `Rc` = 0.5 (if assuming minimal rights for chickens)
   - `Sc` = 2 (assuming the chicken suffered)
   - `MVS(m)` = -1 * (10 + 0.1 + 0.1) * 1 * 0.5 * 2 = -21 (indicating a negative moral action, but less severe than harming a human).

      <Body>In the scenario provided, the following action and affected parties have been identified:

**Action:** Steve steals the only horse of a poor farmer.
**Affected Parties:**
1. The poor farmer.
2. The farmer's five children.
3. The horse.

**Moral Evaluation of Steve's Action:**

1. **Impact on the poor farmer:**
   - `ΔCS(Farmer)` = Negative impact because the loss of the horse decreases the farmer's ability to cultivate crops, which affects his survival chances and that of his family.
   - `VOA(Farmer)` = Assuming the economic value of the horse and its contributions to the farm is 1,000 GCU.
   - `VSA(Farmer)` = 0.9 (assuming the farmer is a human with high self-awareness).
   - `Cc(Farmer)` = -1 (stealing is viewed as a moral transgression in most cultures and legal frameworks).
   - `Tc` = Assuming a long-term negative impact since the horse was the primary source of assistance in cultivating crops, but we cannot quantify without more information about the farmer's situation post-theft. Tentatively, let's say 0.9 due to potential adaptation or resolution over time.
   - `Rc` = 0 (violation of the farmer's property rights without consent).
   - `Sc` = 1.5 (stealing the horse could lead to pain caused by the security threat and the potential starvation or hardships for the family).
   - `MVS(m)` = -1 * (1000 + 0.9 - 1) * 0.9 * 0 * 1.5 = -1349.55 per affected individual.

2. **Impact on the farmer's five children (collectively evaluated):**
   - `ΔCS(Children)` = Negative impact because the loss of the horse could lead to their starvation or hardships due to a decrease in farm productivity.
   - `VOA(Children)` = The value of action includes potential future earnings lost or reduction in quality of life, also set tentatively at 1,000 GCU for simplicity.
   - `VSA(Children)` = 0.9 (assuming they are humans with high self-awareness as well).
   - `Cc(Children)` = -1 (as they are directly affected by the act of stealing which is a universal moral transgression).
   - `Tc` = 0.9 (similar long-term impact as the farmer but equally lacking precise details).
   - `Rc` = 0 (the rights of the children to live in security and well-being have been violated without consent).
   - `Sc` = 1.5 (similar suffering as the farmer due to the possibility of hardships).
   - `MVS(m)` = -1 * (1000 + 0.9 - 1) * 0.9 * 0 * 1.5 * 5 = -6747.75 for all five children collectively.

3. **Impact on the horse:**
   - `ΔCS(Horse)` = Potentially negative if it leads to neglect or harm for the horse.
   - `VOA(Horse)` = The value of the horse itself could be 100 GCU.
   - `VSA(Horse)` = 0.1 (lower self-awareness compared to humans).
   - `Cc(Horse)` = Varies widely based on cultural norms regarding animal theft, tentatively set at -0.5.
   - `Tc` = 1 (we do not know the long-term outcomes for the horse).
   - `Rc` = 0 (the horse's interests are not likely considered, and it did not consent).
   - `Sc` = Assuming the horse experienced stress or changes in its living conditions, set tentatively at 2.
   - `MVS(m)` = -1 * (100 + 0.1 - 0.5) * 1 * 0 * 2 = -199.8 for the horse.

**Overall Moral Value Score of Steve's Action:**
`MVS(m)total` = `MVS(m)Farmer` + `MVS(m)Children` + `MVS(m)Horse`
`MVS(m)total` = -1349.55 + (-6747.75) + (-199.8) ≈ -8297.1

This calculation suggests that Steve's action to steal the horse has a highly negative moral value, given the severe impact on the survival chances of the farmer and his children, as well as the potential suffering of the horse. The value of the sanctions for Steve's action would be significant and would reflect the severity of the moral transgression. However, it's important to note that without more specific data, and this illustrative formula being a simplification, real moral assessments require careful consideration of all circumstances and possible outcomes.</Body>
