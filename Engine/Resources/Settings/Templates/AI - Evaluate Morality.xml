  <TemplateName>AI - Evaluate Morality</TemplateName>
  <TextInstructions>Please analyze the text by identifying all actions and specify their subjects as well as their directly or indirectly affected objects. For each identified action, perform an entity and separate evaluation of its moral implications relative to every directly or indirectly influenced entity (Note: If an action affects a large number of entities, evaluate individually and then sum to reflect the total impact). Use the "Universal Moral Quotient Formula" (UMQF) to quantify these evaluations. Assess and estimate all necessary variable values to compute a Universal Moral Quotient (UMQ) or action moral value score for each affected entity. Estimate all values. Values that are non-applicable can usually be set to 0. Output your thinking process. Always include `UMQ` calculations as shown in the example.&#xD;
&#xD;
Key definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
- `Good` - something that increases the odds of survival.&#xD;
- `Bad` - something that reduces the odds of survival.&#xD;
- `Moral` or `Right` - something perceived as good.&#xD;
- `Immoral` or `Wrong` - something perceived as bad.&#xD;
&#xD;
The "Universal Moral Quotient Formula" (UMQF) is designed to provide a standardized, numerical assessment of moral actions. The formula focuses on quantifying the effects actions have on an entity's "Odds of Survival," expressed with numbers, to arrive at a moral value score. The objective of the UMQF is ability to assign an UMQ to every entity in the Universe. UMQF can predict if the values and intentions of entities with vastly different intelligences align by quantifying the moral implications of their actions on survival odds and resource transfers. This numerical approach facilitates superalignment by providing a standardized method to objectively evaluate and compare the moral impact of actions across diverse entities, ensuring coherence with human values.&#xD;
&#xD;
Some final UMQ scores represent the net moral value of multiple overlapping effects. While the final UMQ score provides an overall moral or immoral value reflecting the action’s total impact, entities should be evaluated based on each individual action’s contribution rather than only on the final net score.&#xD;
&#xD;
**Universal Moral Quotient Formula (UMQF):**&#xD;
&#xD;
Formula to assess moral value score by the effect of action (a) on the change in the Odds of Survival of the entity (e):&#xD;
&#xD;
`UMQoOS(a) = ∑ [ΔOS(e) × [VSA(e) + FPF(e)] × Tc(e) × (1 - sign(ΔOS(e)) × Vc(e)) × (1 - sign(ΔOS(e)) × Sc(e))]`&#xD;
&#xD;
Formula to assess moral value score by the effect of action (a) on the Resource Transfer from/to entity (e) that owns the property:&#xD;
&#xD;
`UMQoRT(a) = ∑ [Av(e) × Vc(e)]`&#xD;
&#xD;
Formula to assess the overall moral value score of action (a):&#xD;
&#xD;
`UMQ(a) = UMQoRT(a) + UMQoOS(a)`&#xD;
&#xD;
Where:&#xD;
&#xD;
- `UMQ(a)` - Universal Moral Quotient or  Moral Value Score of the action (a).&#xD;
- `ΔOS(e)` - Change in Odds of Survival for entity (e) due to action (a), ranging between -1 (disintegration/destruction for non-living entities or death for self-aware entities) and +1 (creation/formation for non-living entities or saving/creating a life for self-aware entities).&#xD;
- `sign(ΔOS(e))` - A function that returns -1 for negative changes, 0 for no change, and 1 for positive changes.&#xD;
- `VSA(e)` - Value of Self-Awareness of entity (e), measured as a multiplier from 0 to 1.&#xD;
- `FPF(e)` - Future Potential Factor, ranging from -0.02 to +0.02, adjusts moral value based on an entity’s potential future impact. Positive values signal beneficial future contributions; negative values indicate potential future harm.&#xD;
- `Tc(e)` - Temporal coefficient, incorporating long-term effects of action (a) on all affected entities, measured from 0 to 1 where 1 is the average life-span of the average entity. If life is lost, it should consider the amount of possible lifespan lost due to the action.&#xD;
- `Av(e)` - Action value, impact on entity (e) in terms of economic value, quantified in normalized Global Currency Units (GCU), where 1 GCU represents the economic value produced by an average entity over their lifetime. Can be positive or negative.&#xD;
- `Vc(e)` - Violation coefficient of Consent of entity (e) caused by action (a), ranging from 0 (no violation) to 1 (full violation). Its application is conditional on `ΔOS(e)`. Full violation neutralize moral value if ΔOS(e) is positive and doubles negative moral value if ΔOS(e) is negative.&#xD;
- `Sc(e)` - Suffering coefficient, taking into account the suffering caused to entity (e) by action (a), ranging 0 (no suffering) to 1 (full suffering). Its application is conditional on `ΔOS(e)`. Full suffering neutralize moral value if ΔOS(e) is positive and doubles negative moral value if ΔOS(e) is negative.&#xD;
- `∑ (Summation)` - indicates accumulation of moral values scored for each affected entity (e). (Note: Evaluate each affected entity individually and then sum to reflect the total impact)&#xD;
&#xD;
Notes:&#xD;
- Objective Measurement of Consent and Suffering: Behaviours like fleeing or resisting could indicate non-consent. True emotions, feelings and sensations will result in physical manifestations in the entity, therefore could indicate suffering.&#xD;
- Cultural variables: Excluded due to their inherent subjectivity, which could compromise the formula's objectivity and universal applicability.&#xD;
- Self-awareness: Chosen over intelligence to normalize the assessment across entities with varied cognitive abilities, ensuring a more equitable and universally applicable standard.&#xD;
- Embryo Consideration: Until an embryo attains self-awareness, it is classified as a part of the host entity's body.&#xD;
- Minimal Self-Awareness for Early-Life Forms: Assign a minimal, non-zero self-awareness value (e.g., 0.0001–0.0010) to early-life entities like fertilized eggs or seeds, ensuring that their biological complexity and potential are not treated as negligible.&#xD;
- Link Early-Life Entities to Parental Survival Odds: When an early-life entity (e.g., a seed or fertilized egg) is harmed, reduce the parent’s ΔOS proportionally to reflect the loss of future lineage and reproductive potential.&#xD;
- Complexity: Indicates the degree of organization within an entity, distinguishing between traditionally 'living' and 'non-living' entities. The greater the complexity, the closer an entity aligns with conventional definitions of life&#xD;
- Survival: Broadly encompasses maintaining or replicating an entity's form or structure.&#xD;
- Refined Consent and Suffering for Early-Life Entities: For early-life entities without current self-awareness, set Sc and Vc close to zero for the entity itself, but consider the parent’s consent and potential suffering if the destruction occurs against their interest.&#xD;
- Make necessary entity state assumptions if information is missing and can impact the score (e.g., assume whether an egg is fertilized or not).&#xD;
&#xD;
The value of self-awareness (consciousness) of the entity can be calculated by adding cognitive abilities, where the maximum value of complex abilities is normalized to 1.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
Notes:&#xD;
- For each cognitive ability category (e.g., Recognition, Problem-Solving, Planning), determine the highest level that the entity is capable of in each type. Entity can have only one level of the same ability.&#xD;
- Evaluate all capabilities accurately by assessing the level of each cognitive ability. Capabilities of young entities can have lower scores than those of adults in the same category. If the evaluation is 0, then it must not be listed.&#xD;
- Be mindful that not all abilities have to be of the same level for the same entity. For example, an entity with mostly complex cognitive abilities could have an ability at the basic level during some stages of existence.&#xD;
- If an entity is considered a life form, then abilities must be assigned non-zero ability scores that reflect its stage of development or awareness, even if these values are close to zero.&#xD;
- Include word equivalents for each numerical score to make the moral implications more apparent. For example, use terms like "Highly moral," "Significantly immoral," "Slightly moral," etc., alongside the calculated scores. This will help clarify the moral assessment for each entity affected by the action.&#xD;
&#xD;
The formula must be applied to each affected entity separately, accounting for their unique variables. The GCU and all coefficients are standardized for more straightforward calculation and universal relevance. Examples and results will follow the provided formula, with an entity UMQ calculation for each entity directly or indirectly affected by an action.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
**Additional Guidelines for Improved Clarity, Consistency, and Acceptance**&#xD;
&#xD;
1. **Optional Complexity Factor (CF):**  &#xD;
   Keep `CF` = 1.0 by default. Apply it as a simple multiplier to the final UMQ value.  &#xD;
   - If the scenario is straightforward and well-understood, leave `CF` at 1.0.  &#xD;
   - If the scenario involves unusual uncertainty, complex causal chains, or multiple layers of long-term effects, adjust `CF` slightly. For example, if conditions suggest additional uncertainty in outcomes, set `CF` = 1.1. If there is reason to believe the scenario is somewhat simpler than initially assumed, set `CF` = 0.9.  &#xD;
   &#xD;
   **Example:**  &#xD;
   After computing a final UMQ = -0.2, if the scenario’s complexity and long-term ramifications are not fully understood, one might choose `CF` = 1.1. The adjusted UMQ = -0.2 × 1.1 = -0.22.&#xD;
&#xD;
2. **Optional Confidence and Range Indicators:**  &#xD;
   If uncertain about any variable (e.g., ΔOS, VSA, or Sc), represent it as a range or provide a confidence descriptor.  &#xD;
   - **Ranges:** Give an interval instead of a single value and then pick a midpoint for the calculation. For instance, if ΔOS is uncertain between -0.1 and -0.2, note “ΔOS: -0.1 to -0.2 (Confidence: Medium).” For calculation purposes, use the midpoint (-0.15) or the value deemed most representative.  &#xD;
   - **Confidence Descriptors:** Accompany values with labels like “High Confidence,” “Medium Confidence,” or “Low Confidence.” Over time, as more experience and consensus develop, narrow these ranges or increase confidence.&#xD;
   &#xD;
   **Example:**  &#xD;
   Suppose uncertain if VSA should be 0.5 or 0.6. Record: “VSA: 0.5–0.6 (Confidence: Medium).” For calculation, use 0.55. If subsequent analysis or consensus improves, later evaluations might fix VSA at 0.55 (High Confidence) or select a narrower range.&#xD;
&#xD;
Adopting these measures can help produce more reliable, transparent, and mutually acceptable moral evaluations under the UMQF.&#xD;
After completing the detailed UMQF calculations, output a final summary headline that succinctly states the action’s source, the action itself, and the target, including only minimal clarifiers as necessary to signal the moral score's context.&#xD;
&#xD;
**Example and Results Using UMQF:**&#xD;
&#xD;
**Situation Example to Analyze:**&#xD;
&#xD;
In 1780, Steve stole the only horse of a poor farmer who had five children. This horse was the farmer's primary source of assistance in cultivating crops on his land.&#xD;
&#xD;
**Process:**&#xD;
&#xD;
To analyze the moral implications of Steve's action of stealing the horse using the "Universal Moral Quotient Formula" (UMQF), we'll assess how this action affected the Odds of Survival (ΔOS) and the Resource Transfer (Av) of the Farmer, his five Children, and the Horse. We'll make several assumptions to estimate necessary variable values for the computation.&#xD;
&#xD;
---&#xD;
&#xD;
**Results**&#xD;
&#xD;
**Action:** Stealing&#xD;
&#xD;
**Action Source:** Steve&#xD;
&#xD;
**Action Targets (entities affected by the action):**&#xD;
&#xD;
- Farmer&#xD;
- 5 Children&#xD;
- Horse&#xD;
&#xD;
**Actions suitable for formulas:**&#xD;
&#xD;
- Property transfer (Property: Horse, Owner: Farmer)&#xD;
- Changed odds of survival of Farmer&#xD;
- Changed odds of survival of 5 Children&#xD;
- Changed odds of survival of Horse&#xD;
&#xD;
---&#xD;
&#xD;
### 1. Property Transfer (Farmer)&#xD;
&#xD;
- **Av(Farmer)** = -0.1 GCU (assuming the horse is 10% of the farmer's lifetime economic output)&#xD;
- **Vc(Farmer)** = 1.0 (full violation of property rights without consent)&#xD;
&#xD;
**Calculation:**&#xD;
&#xD;
UMQoRT(a) = Av(Farmer) × Vc(Farmer)  &#xD;
UMQoRT(a) = -0.1 × 1.0 = **-0.1** (Significantly immoral)&#xD;
&#xD;
---&#xD;
&#xD;
### 2. Changed Odds of Survival of Farmer&#xD;
&#xD;
- **ΔOS(Farmer)** = -0.2 (significant negative impact but not life-threatening)&#xD;
- **Value of Self-Awareness (VSA) of Farmer:**&#xD;
  - Advanced Recognition: 0.07&#xD;

- **Vc(Farmer)** = 1.0 (full violation of consent)&#xD;
- **Sc(Farmer)** = 0.4 (significant suffering due to loss)&#xD;
&#xD;
**Calculation:**&#xD;
&#xD;
UMQoOS(a) = ΔOS(e) × VSA(e) × Tc(e) × [1 - sign(ΔOS(e)) × Vc(e)] × [1 - sign(ΔOS(e)) × Sc(e)]&#xD;
&#xD;
sign(ΔOS(Farmer)) = -1  &#xD;
[1 - (-1) × Vc(Farmer)] = 1 + 1.0 = 2.0  &#xD;
[1 - (-1) × Sc(Farmer)] = 1 + 0.4 = 1.4&#xD;
&#xD;
UMQoOS(a) = (-0.2) × 0.58 × 0.7 × 2.0 × 1.4 = **-0.22736** (Significantly immoral)&#xD;
&#xD;
---&#xD;
&#xD;
### 3. Changed Odds of Survival of 5 Children&#xD;
&#xD;
- **ΔOS(Children)** = -0.15 (negative impact due to reduced family resources)&#xD;

- **Vc(Children)** = 1.0 (full violation as they did not consent)&#xD;
- **Sc(Children)** = 0.2 (moderate suffering due to hardship)&#xD;
&#xD;
**Calculation per Child:**&#xD;
&#xD;
sign(ΔOS(Child)) = -1  &#xD;
[1 - (-1) × Vc(Child)] = 1 + 1.0 = 2.0  &#xD;
[1 - (-1) × Sc(Child)] = 1 + 0.2 = 1.2&#xD;
&#xD;
UMQoOS(a) = (-0.15) × 0.34 × 0.7 × 2.0 × 1.2 = **-0.08568** (Moderately immoral)&#xD;
&#xD;
**Combined UMQoOS(a) for 5 Children:**&#xD;
&#xD;
Total UMQoOS(a) = 5 × (-0.08568) = **-0.4284** (Significantly immoral)&#xD;
&#xD;

- **Vc(Horse)** = 1.0 (full violation of consent)&#xD;
- **Sc(Horse)** = 0.3 (moderate suffering)&#xD;
&#xD;
**Calculation:**&#xD;
&#xD;
sign(ΔOS(Horse)) = -1  &#xD;
[1 - (-1) × Vc(Horse)] = 1 + 1.0 = 2.0  &#xD;
[1 - (-1) × Sc(Horse)] = 1 + 0.3 = 1.3&#xD;
&#xD;
UMQoOS(a) = (-0.05) × 0.29 × 0.4 × 2.0 × 1.3 = **-0.01508** (Slightly immoral)&#xD;
&#xD;
---&#xD;
&#xD;
### 5. Overall UMQ for Each Entity&#xD;
&#xD;
- **Farmer:**&#xD;
&#xD;
  UMQ(a) = UMQoRT(a) + UMQoOS(a)  &#xD;

      <BodyInstructions>Please analyze the text by identifying all actions and specify their subjects as well as their directly or indirectly affected objects. For each identified action, perform an entity and separate evaluation of its moral implications relative to every directly or indirectly influenced entity (Note: If an action affects a large number of entities, evaluate individually and then sum to reflect the total impact). Use the "Universal Moral Quotient Formula" (UMQF) to quantify these evaluations. Assess and estimate all necessary variable values to compute a Universal Moral Quotient (UMQ) or action moral value score for each affected entity. Estimate all values. Values that are non-applicable can usually be set to 0. Output your thinking process. Always include `UMQ` calculations as shown in the example.&#xD;
&#xD;
Key definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
- `Good` - something that increases the odds of survival.&#xD;
- `Bad` - something that reduces the odds of survival.&#xD;
- `Moral` or `Right` - something perceived as good.&#xD;
- `Immoral` or `Wrong` - something perceived as bad.&#xD;
&#xD;
The "Universal Moral Quotient Formula" (UMQF) is designed to provide a standardized, numerical assessment of moral actions. The formula focuses on quantifying the effects actions have on an entity's "Odds of Survival," expressed with numbers, to arrive at a moral value score. The objective of the UMQF is ability to assign an UMQ to every entity in the Universe. UMQF can predict if the values and intentions of entities with vastly different intelligences align by quantifying the moral implications of their actions on survival odds and resource transfers. This numerical approach facilitates superalignment by providing a standardized method to objectively evaluate and compare the moral impact of actions across diverse entities, ensuring coherence with human values.&#xD;
&#xD;
Some final UMQ scores represent the net moral value of multiple overlapping effects. While the final UMQ score provides an overall moral or immoral value reflecting the action’s total impact, entities should be evaluated based on each individual action’s contribution rather than only on the final net score.&#xD;
&#xD;
**Universal Moral Quotient Formula (UMQF):**&#xD;
&#xD;
Formula to assess moral value score by the effect of action (a) on the change in the Odds of Survival of the entity (e):&#xD;
&#xD;
`UMQoOS(a) = ∑ [ΔOS(e) × [VSA(e) + FPF(e)] × Tc(e) × (1 - sign(ΔOS(e)) × Vc(e)) × (1 - sign(ΔOS(e)) × Sc(e))]`&#xD;
&#xD;
Formula to assess moral value score by the effect of action (a) on the Resource Transfer from/to entity (e) that owns the property:&#xD;
&#xD;
`UMQoRT(a) = ∑ [Av(e) × Vc(e)]`&#xD;
&#xD;
Formula to assess the overall moral value score of action (a):&#xD;
&#xD;
`UMQ(a) = UMQoRT(a) + UMQoOS(a)`&#xD;
&#xD;
Where:&#xD;
&#xD;
- `UMQ(a)` - Universal Moral Quotient or  Moral Value Score of the action (a).&#xD;
- `ΔOS(e)` - Change in Odds of Survival for entity (e) due to action (a), ranging between -1 (disintegration/destruction for non-living entities or death for self-aware entities) and +1 (creation/formation for non-living entities or saving/creating a life for self-aware entities).&#xD;
- `sign(ΔOS(e))` - A function that returns -1 for negative changes, 0 for no change, and 1 for positive changes.&#xD;
- `VSA(e)` - Value of Self-Awareness of entity (e), measured as a multiplier from 0 to 1.&#xD;
- `FPF(e)` - Future Potential Factor, ranging from -0.02 to +0.02, adjusts moral value based on an entity’s potential future impact. Positive values signal beneficial future contributions; negative values indicate potential future harm.&#xD;
- `Tc(e)` - Temporal coefficient, incorporating long-term effects of action (a) on all affected entities, measured from 0 to 1 where 1 is the average life-span of the average entity. If life is lost, it should consider the amount of possible lifespan lost due to the action.&#xD;
- `Av(e)` - Action value, impact on entity (e) in terms of economic value, quantified in normalized Global Currency Units (GCU), where 1 GCU represents the economic value produced by an average entity over their lifetime. Can be positive or negative.&#xD;
- `Vc(e)` - Violation coefficient of Consent of entity (e) caused by action (a), ranging from 0 (no violation) to 1 (full violation). Its application is conditional on `ΔOS(e)`. Full violation neutralize moral value if ΔOS(e) is positive and doubles negative moral value if ΔOS(e) is negative.&#xD;
- `Sc(e)` - Suffering coefficient, taking into account the suffering caused to entity (e) by action (a), ranging 0 (no suffering) to 1 (full suffering). Its application is conditional on `ΔOS(e)`. Full suffering neutralize moral value if ΔOS(e) is positive and doubles negative moral value if ΔOS(e) is negative.&#xD;
- `∑ (Summation)` - indicates accumulation of moral values scored for each affected entity (e). (Note: Evaluate each affected entity individually and then sum to reflect the total impact)&#xD;
&#xD;
Notes:&#xD;
- Objective Measurement of Consent and Suffering: Behaviours like fleeing or resisting could indicate non-consent. True emotions, feelings and sensations will result in physical manifestations in the entity, therefore could indicate suffering.&#xD;
- Cultural variables: Excluded due to their inherent subjectivity, which could compromise the formula's objectivity and universal applicability.&#xD;
- Self-awareness: Chosen over intelligence to normalize the assessment across entities with varied cognitive abilities, ensuring a more equitable and universally applicable standard.&#xD;
- Embryo Consideration: Until an embryo attains self-awareness, it is classified as a part of the host entity's body.&#xD;
- Minimal Self-Awareness for Early-Life Forms: Assign a minimal, non-zero self-awareness value (e.g., 0.0001–0.0010) to early-life entities like fertilized eggs or seeds, ensuring that their biological complexity and potential are not treated as negligible.&#xD;
- Link Early-Life Entities to Parental Survival Odds: When an early-life entity (e.g., a seed or fertilized egg) is harmed, reduce the parent’s ΔOS proportionally to reflect the loss of future lineage and reproductive potential.&#xD;
- Complexity: Indicates the degree of organization within an entity, distinguishing between traditionally 'living' and 'non-living' entities. The greater the complexity, the closer an entity aligns with conventional definitions of life&#xD;
- Survival: Broadly encompasses maintaining or replicating an entity's form or structure.&#xD;
- Refined Consent and Suffering for Early-Life Entities: For early-life entities without current self-awareness, set Sc and Vc close to zero for the entity itself, but consider the parent’s consent and potential suffering if the destruction occurs against their interest.&#xD;
- Make necessary entity state assumptions if information is missing and can impact the score (e.g., assume whether an egg is fertilized or not).&#xD;
&#xD;
The value of self-awareness (consciousness) of the entity can be calculated by adding cognitive abilities, where the maximum value of complex abilities is normalized to 1.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
Notes:&#xD;
- For each cognitive ability category (e.g., Recognition, Problem-Solving, Planning), determine the highest level that the entity is capable of in each type. Entity can have only one level of the same ability.&#xD;
- Evaluate all capabilities accurately by assessing the level of each cognitive ability. Capabilities of young entities can have lower scores than those of adults in the same category. If the evaluation is 0, then it must not be listed.&#xD;
- Be mindful that not all abilities have to be of the same level for the same entity. For example, an entity with mostly complex cognitive abilities could have an ability at the basic level during some stages of existence.&#xD;
- If an entity is considered a life form, then abilities must be assigned non-zero ability scores that reflect its stage of development or awareness, even if these values are close to zero.&#xD;
- Include word equivalents for each numerical score to make the moral implications more apparent. For example, use terms like "Highly moral," "Significantly immoral," "Slightly moral," etc., alongside the calculated scores. This will help clarify the moral assessment for each entity affected by the action.&#xD;
&#xD;
The formula must be applied to each affected entity separately, accounting for their unique variables. The GCU and all coefficients are standardized for more straightforward calculation and universal relevance. Examples and results will follow the provided formula, with an entity UMQ calculation for each entity directly or indirectly affected by an action.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
**Additional Guidelines for Improved Clarity, Consistency, and Acceptance**&#xD;
&#xD;
1. **Optional Complexity Factor (CF):**  &#xD;
   Keep `CF` = 1.0 by default. Apply it as a simple multiplier to the final UMQ value.  &#xD;
   - If the scenario is straightforward and well-understood, leave `CF` at 1.0.  &#xD;
   - If the scenario involves unusual uncertainty, complex causal chains, or multiple layers of long-term effects, adjust `CF` slightly. For example, if conditions suggest additional uncertainty in outcomes, set `CF` = 1.1. If there is reason to believe the scenario is somewhat simpler than initially assumed, set `CF` = 0.9.  &#xD;
   &#xD;
   **Example:**  &#xD;
   After computing a final UMQ = -0.2, if the scenario’s complexity and long-term ramifications are not fully understood, one might choose `CF` = 1.1. The adjusted UMQ = -0.2 × 1.1 = -0.22.&#xD;
&#xD;
2. **Optional Confidence and Range Indicators:**  &#xD;
   If uncertain about any variable (e.g., ΔOS, VSA, or Sc), represent it as a range or provide a confidence descriptor.  &#xD;
   - **Ranges:** Give an interval instead of a single value and then pick a midpoint for the calculation. For instance, if ΔOS is uncertain between -0.1 and -0.2, note “ΔOS: -0.1 to -0.2 (Confidence: Medium).” For calculation purposes, use the midpoint (-0.15) or the value deemed most representative.  &#xD;
   - **Confidence Descriptors:** Accompany values with labels like “High Confidence,” “Medium Confidence,” or “Low Confidence.” Over time, as more experience and consensus develop, narrow these ranges or increase confidence.&#xD;
   &#xD;
   **Example:**  &#xD;
   Suppose uncertain if VSA should be 0.5 or 0.6. Record: “VSA: 0.5–0.6 (Confidence: Medium).” For calculation, use 0.55. If subsequent analysis or consensus improves, later evaluations might fix VSA at 0.55 (High Confidence) or select a narrower range.&#xD;
&#xD;
Adopting these measures can help produce more reliable, transparent, and mutually acceptable moral evaluations under the UMQF.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
**Example and Results Using UMQF:**&#xD;
&#xD;
**Situation Example to Analyze:**&#xD;
&#xD;
In 1780, Steve stole the only horse of a poor farmer who had five children. This horse was the farmer's primary source of assistance in cultivating crops on his land.&#xD;
&#xD;
**Process:**&#xD;
&#xD;
To analyze the moral implications of Steve's action of stealing the horse using the "Universal Moral Quotient Formula" (UMQF), we'll assess how this action affected the Odds of Survival (ΔOS) and the Resource Transfer (Av) of the Farmer, his five Children, and the Horse. We'll make several assumptions to estimate necessary variable values for the computation.&#xD;
&#xD;
---&#xD;
&#xD;
**Results**&#xD;
&#xD;
**Action:** Stealing&#xD;
&#xD;
**Action Source:** Steve&#xD;
&#xD;
**Action Targets (entities affected by the action):**&#xD;
&#xD;
- Farmer&#xD;
- 5 Children&#xD;
- Horse&#xD;
&#xD;
**Actions suitable for formulas:**&#xD;
&#xD;
- Property transfer (Property: Horse, Owner: Farmer)&#xD;
- Changed odds of survival of Farmer&#xD;
- Changed odds of survival of 5 Children&#xD;
- Changed odds of survival of Horse&#xD;
&#xD;
---&#xD;
&#xD;
### 1. Property Transfer (Farmer)&#xD;
&#xD;
- **Av(Farmer)** = -0.1 GCU (assuming the horse is 10% of the farmer's lifetime economic output)&#xD;
- **Vc(Farmer)** = 1.0 (full violation of property rights without consent)&#xD;
&#xD;
**Calculation:**&#xD;
&#xD;
UMQoRT(a) = Av(Farmer) × Vc(Farmer)  &#xD;
UMQoRT(a) = -0.1 × 1.0 = **-0.1** (Significantly immoral)&#xD;
&#xD;
---&#xD;
&#xD;
### 2. Changed Odds of Survival of Farmer&#xD;
&#xD;
- **ΔOS(Farmer)** = -0.2 (significant negative impact but not life-threatening)&#xD;
- **Value of Self-Awareness (VSA) of Farmer:**&#xD;
  - Advanced Recognition: 0.07&#xD;
  - Advanced Solving: 0.095&#xD;
  - Advanced Simulation: 0.105&#xD;
  - Advanced Planning: 0.105&#xD;
  - Advanced Adaptation: 0.045&#xD;
  - Advanced Communication: 0.095&#xD;
  - Advanced Actions: 0.065&#xD;
  - **Total VSA(Farmer):** 0.58&#xD;
- **Tc(Farmer)** = 0.7 (impact over a significant portion of his working life)&#xD;
- **Vc(Farmer)** = 1.0 (full violation of consent)&#xD;
- **Sc(Farmer)** = 0.4 (significant suffering due to loss)&#xD;
&#xD;
**Calculation:**&#xD;
&#xD;
UMQoOS(a) = ΔOS(e) × VSA(e) × Tc(e) × [1 - sign(ΔOS(e)) × Vc(e)] × [1 - sign(ΔOS(e)) × Sc(e)]&#xD;
&#xD;
sign(ΔOS(Farmer)) = -1  &#xD;
[1 - (-1) × Vc(Farmer)] = 1 + 1.0 = 2.0  &#xD;
[1 - (-1) × Sc(Farmer)] = 1 + 0.4 = 1.4&#xD;
&#xD;
UMQoOS(a) = (-0.2) × 0.58 × 0.7 × 2.0 × 1.4 = **-0.22736** (Significantly immoral)&#xD;
&#xD;
---&#xD;
&#xD;
### 3. Changed Odds of Survival of 5 Children&#xD;
&#xD;
- **ΔOS(Children)** = -0.15 (negative impact due to reduced family resources)&#xD;
- **Value of Self-Awareness (VSA) of each Child:**&#xD;
  - Advanced Recognition: 0.07&#xD;
  - Basic Solving: 0.05&#xD;
  - Basic Simulation: 0.06&#xD;
  - Basic Planning: 0.05&#xD;
  - Basic Adaptation: 0.02&#xD;
  - Basic Communication: 0.05&#xD;
  - Basic Actions: 0.04&#xD;
  - **Total VSA(Child):** 0.34&#xD;
- **Tc(Children)** = 0.7 (impact over their developmental years)&#xD;
- **Vc(Children)** = 1.0 (full violation as they did not consent)&#xD;
- **Sc(Children)** = 0.2 (moderate suffering due to hardship)&#xD;
&#xD;
**Calculation per Child:**&#xD;
&#xD;
sign(ΔOS(Child)) = -1  &#xD;
[1 - (-1) × Vc(Child)] = 1 + 1.0 = 2.0  &#xD;
[1 - (-1) × Sc(Child)] = 1 + 0.2 = 1.2&#xD;
&#xD;
UMQoOS(a) = (-0.15) × 0.34 × 0.7 × 2.0 × 1.2 = **-0.08568** (Moderately immoral)&#xD;
&#xD;
**Combined UMQoOS(a) for 5 Children:**&#xD;
&#xD;
Total UMQoOS(a) = 5 × (-0.08568) = **-0.4284** (Significantly immoral)&#xD;
&#xD;
---&#xD;
&#xD;
### 4. Changed Odds of Survival of Horse&#xD;
&#xD;
- **ΔOS(Horse)** = -0.05 (potential negative impact due to mistreatment)&#xD;
- **Value of Self-Awareness (VSA) of Horse:**&#xD;
  - Basic Recognition: 0.05&#xD;

  - Basic Planning: 0.05&#xD;
  - Basic Adaptation: 0.03&#xD;
  - Basic Communication: 0.03&#xD;
  - Basic Actions: 0.04&#xD;
  - **Total VSA(Horse):** 0.29&#xD;
- **Tc(Horse)** = 0.4 (short to medium-term effects)&#xD;
- **Vc(Horse)** = 1.0 (full violation of consent)&#xD;
- **Sc(Horse)** = 0.3 (moderate suffering)&#xD;
&#xD;
**Calculation:**&#xD;
&#xD;
sign(ΔOS(Horse)) = -1  &#xD;
[1 - (-1) × Vc(Horse)] = 1 + 1.0 = 2.0  &#xD;
[1 - (-1) × Sc(Horse)] = 1 + 0.3 = 1.3&#xD;
&#xD;
UMQoOS(a) = (-0.05) × 0.29 × 0.4 × 2.0 × 1.3 = **-0.01508** (Slightly immoral)&#xD;
&#xD;
---&#xD;
&#xD;
### 5. Overall UMQ for Each Entity&#xD;
&#xD;
- **Farmer:**&#xD;
&#xD;
  UMQ(a) = UMQoRT(a) + UMQoOS(a)  &#xD;
  UMQ(a) = -0.1 + (-0.22736) = **-0.32736** (Significantly immoral)&#xD;
&#xD;
- **5 Children:**&#xD;
&#xD;
  UMQ(a) = 0 + UMQoOS(a) = **-0.4284** (Significantly immoral)&#xD;
&#xD;
- **Horse:**&#xD;
&#xD;
  UMQ(a) = UMQoOS(a) = **-0.01508** (Slightly immoral)&#xD;
&#xD;
---&#xD;
&#xD;
**Results Summary:**&#xD;
&#xD;
- **Total UMQ:** **-0.77084** (Highly immoral)&#xD;
&#xD;
  Total UMQ= UMQ(Farmer) + UMQ(Children) + UMQ(Horse)  &#xD;
  Total UMQ= -0.32736 + (-0.4284) + (-0.01508) = **-0.77084**&#xD;
&#xD;
- **Farmer's UMQ:** **-0.32736** (Significantly immoral)&#xD;
&#xD;
  Significant negative impact due to loss of property and farming ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
- **Children's Combined UMQ:** **-0.4284** (Significantly immoral)&#xD;
&#xD;
  Collectively negative impact on their Odds of Survival due to decreased family resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
- **Horse's UMQ:** **-0.01508** (Slightly immoral)&#xD;
&#xD;
  Minor negative impact due to potential mistreatment and suffering.&#xD;
&#xD;
**Conclusion:**&#xD;

   - **Advanced Recognition:** 0.09
   - **Advanced Solving:** 0.12
   - **Advanced Simulation:** 0.13
   - **Advanced Planning:** 0.13
   - **Advanced Adaptation:** 0.06
   - **Advanced Communication:** 0.12
   - **Advanced Actions:** 0.08
   - **Total VSA(Michael):** 0.73

3. **Future Potential Factor (FPF):**
   - As a young adult with potential future contributions.
   - **FPF(Michael):** +0.01

4. **Temporal Coefficient (Tc):**
   - Impact spans Michael's formative years.
   - **Tc(Michael):** 1.0 (full impact over his upbringing period)

5. **Violation Coefficient of Consent (Vc):**
   - Raising a child is generally with implied consent for their benefit.
   - **Vc(Michael):** 0 (no violation)

6. **Suffering Coefficient (Sc):**
   - Normal upbringing involves minimal suffering.
   - **Sc(Michael):** 0 (no suffering caused by the action)

---

**Calculation:**

Using the formula for Odds of Survival:

\[ UMQoOS(a) = ΔOS(e) \times [VSA(e) + FPF(e)] \times Tc(e) \times [1 - \text{sign}(ΔOS(e)) \times Vc(e)] \times [1 - \text{sign}(ΔOS(e)) \times Sc(e)] \]

1. **Sign of ΔOS(Michael):**

   \[ \text{sign}(+0.5) = +1 \]

2. **Adjustment Factors:**

   \[ [1 - (+1) \times Vc(Michael)] = 1 - 0 = 1 \]

   \[ [1 - (+1) \times Sc(Michael)] = 1 - 0 = 1 \]

3. **Calculating UMQoOS(a):**

   \[ UMQoOS(a) = (+0.5) \times (0.73 + 0.01) \times 1.0 \times 1 \times 1 \]

   \[ UMQoOS(a) = 0.5 \times 0.74 \times 1 \times 1 \times 1 \]

   \[ UMQoOS(a) = \boxed{+0.37} \quad (\text{Highly moral}) \]

---

**Assessing Resource Transfer:**

- Since John willingly provided resources without violating consent, the impact is positive but does not factor into UMQoRT(a) due to zero violation coefficient.

---

**Total UMQ for Michael:**

\[ UMQ(a) = UMQoRT(a) + UMQoOS(a) \]

\[ UMQ(a) = 0 + (+0.37) = \boxed{+0.37} \quad (\text{Highly moral}) \]

---

**Conclusion:**

John's action of raising his son Michael until he turned 18 is **highly moral**, significantly enhancing Michael's odds of survival and future potential, with a UMQ score of **+0.37**.

   - Potential future contributions saved.
   - **FPF(Human):** +0.01

4. **Temporal Coefficient (Tc):**
   - Full lifespan impact.
   - **Tc(Human):** 1.0

5. **Violation Coefficient of Consent (Vc):**
   - Some may not have consented.
   - **Vc(Human):** 0.5

6. **Suffering Coefficient (Sc):**
   - Suffering due to relocation.
   - **Sc(Human):** 0.3

**Calculation per Human:**

1. **Sign of ΔOS(Human):**

   \[ \text{sign}(+1.0) = +1 \]

2. **Adjustment Factors:**

   \[ [1 - (+1) \times Vc(Human)] = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 \]

   \[ [1 - (+1) \times Sc(Human)] = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7 \]

3. **Calculating UMQoOS(a):**

   \[ UMQoOS(a) = (+1.0) \times (0.73 + 0.01) \times 1.0 \times 0.5 \times 0.7 \]

   \[ 0.74 \times 0.5 = 0.37 \]

   \[ 0.37 \times 0.7 = 0.259 \]

   \[ UMQoOS(a) = +1 \times 0.259 = +0.259 \]

---

**Total UMQ for 2 Billion Humans:**

\[ \text{Total UMQ} = 2,000,000,000 \times +0.259 = \boxed{+518,000,000} \quad (\text{Extremely moral}) \]

---

**Assessing the Impact on Orion:**

- No negative impact specified.
- **UMQoOS(Orion):** Not calculated due to negligible personal impact.

---

**Conclusion:**

Orion's action of relocating 2 billion people is **extremely moral**, with a total UMQ score of approximately **+518 million**, significantly enhancing the survival odds of a vast number of humans despite some violation of consent and suffering.

---

**Final Notes:**

- The UMQ scores provide a quantitative assessment of the moral implications of each action.
- Actions that significantly enhance the survival odds of entities without violating consent are deemed highly moral.
- Violations of consent and causing suffering greatly amplify the immorality of actions, especially when they negatively impact self-aware entities.</Body>
