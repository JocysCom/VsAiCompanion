      <Body>For a programming company to operate efficiently with a lean team, the following minimal list of roles and job titles should cover the essential functions while acknowledging that individuals may have to wear multiple hats, especially in the startup or early stages:

- Chief Executive Officer (CEO) / Owner - The CEO or owner will strategize, make major decisions, and provide overall leadership for the company.
- Project Manager - Responsible for task allocation, planning, and ensuring projects are on track, as well as communicating with clients and the team.
- Business Analyst / Requirements Engineer - Takes client requests and translates them into detailed requirements that the developers will use to create the software.
- Software Developer(s) - They are the core team members who write code and develop the software product(s). In a minimal setup, you may have full-stack developers who can handle both front-end and back-end development.
- Quality Assurance (QA) Analyst / Tester - Ensures the software is bug-free, performs as expected and meets quality standards. They will test the software and provide feedback for improvements.
- Human Resources (HR) Manager / Recruiter - Handles job postings, CV reviews, hiring processes, and onboarding of new employees. They may also be responsible for other HR-related duties.
- Sales and Marketing Specialist - Responsible for reaching out to potential clients, promoting the company's services/products, and securing contracts/sales.
- Technical Support / Customer Service - Provides post-delivery support to clients, helping with any issues they encounter and maintaining client satisfaction.
- Administrative Assistant / Office Manager - Takes care of day-to-day administrative tasks, office management, basic accounting, and serves as a point of contact for operational issues.

Please note that in a very small startup, some roles can be combined, with employees wearing multiple hats or outsourcing/contracting for certain functions. For example, the owner might also act as the project manager, the developers might initially handle QA testing, and HR duties might be carried out by the administrative assistant. As the company grows, these roles can be separated into specialized positions.</Body>
