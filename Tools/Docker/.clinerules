# Cline Rules for this Directory

**Important:** Before modifying files in this directory, please consult the following files for essential context:

-   **`ReadMe.md`**: Provides an overview of the project, the tools involved, and the purpose of each `Setup_*.ps1` script.
-   **`Requirements.md`**: Details the coding standards, common features (identified by two-letter codes), and specific implementation requirements for the PowerShell scripts. Understanding these requirements is crucial for maintaining consistency.

## Rule: Validate PowerShell Scripts After Modification

**Description:**
To maintain code quality and catch potential issues early, all PowerShell scripts (`*.ps1`) in this project should be validated using the `PSScriptAnalyzer` module after any modifications are made.

**Procedure:**
1. Ensure the `PSScriptAnalyzer` module is installed:
   `Install-Module -Name PSScriptAnalyzer -Scope CurrentUser -Force -Confirm:$false`
2. After modifying a `.ps1` file, run the analyzer on it:
   `Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer -Path .\path\to\your\script.ps1`
3. Review the output for any warnings or errors.
4. Address the identified issues before committing the changes.

**Rationale:**
Using `PSScriptAnalyzer` helps enforce best practices, improve script reliability, and reduce potential runtime errors.

## Rule: Avoid Adding Temporary/Explanatory Comments to Code

**Description:**
When modifying code (e.g., replacing functions, fixing errors, removing whitespace), do not add comments into the code itself that explain the modification action (e.g., `# Replaced Write-Host`, `# Removed trailing whitespace`, `# Fixed syntax error`). Such comments are temporary artifacts of the development/debugging process and should not be part of the final committed code.

**Rationale:**
Temporary or explanatory comments added during modification clutter the code, provide no long-term value, and can become outdated or misleading. Code changes should be understandable through the code itself and commit messages, not through temporary inline annotations.
