# OpenAI Schema to C# Models Generator

Transform API specifications into precise, optimized C# model classes. This tool preserves original naming and casing, eliminating the need for manual renaming or extra serialization attributes. By analyzing common property patterns, it builds optimal inheritance hierarchies that cut down on redundant code and simplify maintenance.

## Key Benefits

- **Exact Naming:** Generates models that exactly mirror defined API schema.
- **Automatic Inheritance:** Detects shared properties and creates efficient parent-child relationships.
- **Clean Code:** Produces minimal and uncluttered C# code.
- **Seamless Schema Sync:** Updates models in line with API changes without extensive rework.
- **Flexible Customization:** Allows to adapt models to specific project needs while maintaining the API contract.
- **Enhanced Efficiency:** Automates model creation, reducing errors and saving development time.
