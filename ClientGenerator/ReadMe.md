## Introduction

OpenApiCSharpGen is a specialized tool designed to generate precise and optimized C# model classes directly from OpenAPI specifications. Unlike traditional generators, it fully respects the naming and casing conventions exactly as developers declared, eliminating the need for serialization attributes and manual name overrides. Leveraging intelligent inheritance detection, OpenApiCSharpGen automatically creates optimal parent-child relationships, significantly reducing code redundancy and improving maintainability. Built for developers who prioritize clean, performant, and maintainable codebases, this tool simplifies the C# model generation process from OpenAPI definitions.

### Benefits:

- **Exact Name and Case Preservation:** Generates C# models precisely matching the original OpenAPI definition without relying on serializer attributes.
- **Automatic Inheritance Detection:** Optimally identifies and implements proper inheritance relationships to minimize repetitive code.
- **Cleaner and Maintainable Code:** Reduces unnecessary code duplication, significantly simplifying future model modifications and extensions.
- **Improved Development Efficiency:** Automates model scaffolding tasks, freeing developer resources from manual generation and costly corrections.

# OpenAI Schema to C# Models Generator

The OpenAI Schema to C# Models Generator is a specialized tool designed to transform OpenAI API specifications into precise, clean C# model classes with unparalleled fidelity to the original schema. Unlike conventional code generators, this tool preserves exact naming conventions as defined by API developers without imposing C#-specific naming transformations or unnecessary serialization attributes. It intelligently analyzes property patterns across models to establish optimal inheritance hierarchies, dramatically reducing code duplication while maintaining complete compatibility with OpenAI's API structure. Designed for developers who value clean code and precise API integration, this generator bridges the gap between OpenAI's specifications and .NET applications with minimal friction.

## Benefits:

* **Exact Naming Preservation** - Maintains the precise property and class names as defined in the OpenAI schema without forcing C# naming conventions.

* **Optimal Inheritance Hierarchies** - Automatically identifies common property patterns to create efficient class hierarchies, reducing code duplication and maintenance overhead.

* **Zero Serialization Attributes** - Generates clean models without cluttering code with unnecessary JsonProperty attributes when standard serialization works.

* **Developer-Friendly Output** - Produces readable, well-structured C# code that follows best practices and is easy to integrate into existing projects.

* **Schema Evolution Support** - Adapts seamlessly to OpenAI API changes, ensuring your models stay in sync with the latest specifications.

* **Customization Without Compromise** - Allows fine-tuning of generated models while maintaining the integrity of the original API contract.
