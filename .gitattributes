# Enforce consistent line endings of all text files that arenâ€™t gitignored across all users,
# regardless of their Git configurations.
# It overrides individual 'core.autocrlf' settings for the files specified.
# Text files will have LF line endings in the repository.
# On checkout, text files will have native line endings in the working directory:
#   - CRLF on Windows
#   - LF on Linux/macOS/FreeBSD
# Binary files are automatically detected and are not affected by this setting.
#
# Useful commands:
#
#  - List files with CRLF ending in repository:
#    git ls-files --eol | where { $_.StartsWith("i/crlf")}
#
#  - Update all tracked files in repo according to the rules:
#    git add --renormalize .
#
* text=auto

* -text
# Exclude files from language stats
